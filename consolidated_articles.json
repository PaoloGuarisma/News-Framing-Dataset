Robert Greenberg, Dean of Arts, University of Auckland The world was excited by the news last week that NASA's Perseverance rover had\u00a0successfully landed\u00a0in a Martian crater. The rover will now set about collecting samples from what scientists say was an ancient lake fed by a river. The name of this exotic Martian crater is\u00a0Jezero. As a South Slavic linguist, I immediately recognised the word. In several former Yugoslav countries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia, \"jezero\" (pronounced \"yeh-zeh-ro,\" with the stress on the first syllable) means lake. Fair enough \u2014 but why a Balkan lake on Mars? The task of providing names for places of interest on Mars falls to the International Astronomical Union (IAU). They apparently named the Martian crater Jezero in 2007, well before earthlings had paid any attention. I later discovered the name was not, in fact, intended simply as a generic \"lake,\" but refers to a specific village called Jezero. With a population around 500, it is located in western Republika Srpska, the Serb-dominated part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is very near a river-fed lake called Veliko Plivsko Jezero, or Great Plivsko Lake. According to the\u00a0Balkan Insight\u00a0news service, the mayor of Jezero first learned of NASA's plans in a letter from the US ambassador in Bosnia and Herzegovina, informing her the village and its name were to be honored by the spacecraft landing in the Jezero crater.  The villagers apparently first\u00a0dismissed this as fake news. But, to their later amazement, people all over the world have now been learning to pronounce Jezero properly. The landing was broadcast live at the village's only school, with the Balkan Insight reporter describing the villagers as \"star-struck\" and justifiably proud of their connection to the mission. There was also cautious optimism about the prosperity that might flow from tourists discovering their sleepy hamlet (at least after the pandemic). Famous on Mars, might Jezero be celebrated on Earth as well? The alternative to be avoided, one hopes, is that a minor Balkan conflict breaks out over language and designated names. Every one of the former Yugoslav countries can claim the word \"jezero\" in their respective dictionaries. And any traveller to the Balkans knows the region is rich with lakes. But only one village carries this generic word as its name. Was it politically advisable for one village in the Serb-dominated entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be singled out? For many, this part of the country is still associated with the nationalism and ethnic cleansing of the\u00a0Bosnian war\u00a0in the 1990s. Read more:\u00a0'7 minutes of terror': a look at the technology Perseverance will need to survive landing on Mars How would the members of other communities in the country \u2014 Bosniaks (the country's Muslim population) and Croats \u2014 respond? Could they support the Serbs of Jezero receiving such positive media coverage? As my book about the\u00a0break-up of the Serbo-Croatian language\u00a0explored, language rifts in the Balkans are endemic and have long been both a symptom of ethnic animosity and a cause for inflaming it. Will people quibble over whether the crater is named for the village or for its nearby lake, or any lake within the region? Or should all who say \"jezero\" feel proud the word is now in the global lexicon?  During the time of Tito's rule in Yugoslavia, such matters would not have been as contentious, since many people believed the dominant common language of the country was Serbo-Croatian. Ethno-nationalism was forbidden and people mostly got along. However, since the violent break-up of Yugoslavia, people in the newly independent states now speak separate languages: Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian. Read more:\u00a0Remembering Srebrenica, more than 20 years on Over the years, speakers of the four languages have slowly drifted apart, but they all agree a lake is called \"jezero\". Further complications arise with peoples and governments even further afield. The Slovenes and Czechs also say \"jezero,\" and the Macedonian and Bulgarian form is the almost identical \"ezero\". Any similarity between the landscape around Jezero in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the crater with the same name on Mars may end with the name. And I doubt the scientists at NASA or the IAU ever considered the potential implications of using a common word shared by so many nations to name an important site on Mars. But, as we know, words have power. It would be a shame if a distant, silent crater on another planet caused envy and resentment here on Earth. So far, however, the political situation in the Balkans remains almost as calm as that on Mars, and that is cause for hope.

Of these, more than half failed at stages from take-off to deployment \u2014 including the 1999 Mars Climate Orbiter, destroyed on Mars entry after someone\u00a0failed to convert\u00a0imperial measurements to metric.

Read more:\u00a0As new probes reach Mars, here's what we know so far from trips to the red planet Images taken by orbiters reveal Mars has more than 40,000 craters, each formed by an asteroid colliding with the surface. You can explore these craters yourself by going to Google Earth, toggling the Google Mars mode and zooming in. If some of the debris from the large impacts reached\u00a0escape velocity\u00a0(about 5 km/s on Mars), it would be able to leave the planet\u2019s gravitational field. Eventually, some of the ejected Martian material has intercepted Earth\u2019s trajectory, flashing through the atmosphere until it either burned up or came to rest on the surface. Although Martian meteorites have been found across Earth, most have been collected from Antarctica or the deserts of northwest Africa. In both cases, the black crust that forms as the meteorite partially burns up passing through Earth\u2019s atmosphere stands out clearly against ice or sand. This mode of interplanetary travel is important because it raises the possibility that life could inadvertently travel from one planet to another. Back in 1996, one Martian meteorite,\u00a0ALH84001, was controversially thought to contain fossilized bacteria. Some of the older landers have almost certainly taken Earth bacteria to Mars, since they were not purified before launch. Small planets cool quickly and it has long been suspected that Mars\u2019s core has largely but not totally\u00a0crystallised. This means Mars has mostly lost the protective magnetic field that deflects cosmic radiation. But we are confident Mars once had an ocean, containing water as we know it. The temperature was above freezing and conditions were suitable for life. The stripping away of the magnetic field early in Mars\u2019s history means this ocean is long gone and the average temperature is now -65\u2103, but frosts, clouds and ice caps remain.  Not being fortunate enough to roam the deserts of Africa or the icy plateaus of Antarctica, I instead found my first Martian meteorite sitting in a cabinet in a gem store in the small New Zealand town of Akaroa. Using a scanning electron microscope, my examination revealed it was a shergottite, one of the\u00a0most common Martian meteorites\u00a0\u2014 equivalent to what we know on Earth as basalt. If it\u2019s basalt, though, how do we know it's from Mars? There are several ways of recognizing a Martian meteorite. One is from its gas content. When a meteorite strikes the surface of Mars, the \"target\" rocks are subject to such great pressures they partly melt and trap Martian atmosphere within gas bubbles. Some of these rocks are then ejected from the planet \u2014 becoming meteorites themselves. The gases in these meteorites can be measured back on Earth and compared to the known Martian atmosphere, which comprises\u00a095% carbon dioxide\u00a0and distinct\u00a0noble gas\u00a0concentrations. The thousands of craters scarring Mars' surface mean it is ancient. This was confirmed when one meteorite was dated to be\u00a04.4 billion years old. Properties of some other Martian meteorites show Mars\u00a0formed within 13 million years\u00a0of the formation of the Solar System. This in turn means some of the first planetary crust that formed on Mars likely still exists at the surface. This inference, along with some meteorite mineral and isotopic properties, implies Mars has not been shaped by plate tectonics \u2014 the global process that formed the continents, mountain ranges and ocean basins on Earth. And, as most dated Martian meteorites are less than 1.5 billion years old, volcanism has continued throughout its history. Mars may be cold but it is not dead. Martian meteorites also hold clues about how people may one day be able to survive on the planet. While living in hollowed out lava tubes in Martian basalt may appeal to some hopeful interplanetary settlers, we\u2019ll ultimately need to build shelters to protect us from the cosmic radiation and vast dust storms that engulf the planet. Martian meteorites show olivine, a magnesium-silicate mineral, is common. Experiments are underway to assess the use of a breakdown component, magnesium carbonate, to form a concrete binder from which we could fashion buildings. Martian meteorites show that big insights can be gleaned from little rocks and reveal what Mars is made of.

The satellites may include capabilities to study targets in optical wavelengths or synthetic aperture radar, and could carry electronic intelligence payloads, Space News added. Past launches put the Yaogan satellites at orbits of roughly 680 miles (1,100 kilometers) in altitude and inclined by 63 degrees, passing over maritime regions such as the South Shetland Islands. This is the third clutch of Yaogan satellites to launch from China. The second group went to space just a few weeks ago, on Jan. 28, according to contractor China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. The first group reportedly launched in April 2018 in similar orbits, allowing China to shorten the time between when a particular region is visible under the growing constellation. China has had a busy February in space, including the successful arrival of Tianwen-1 in Mars orbit and preparation for a Mars landing, reports that its first space station module is preparing for a flight, and ongoing examinations of rocks on the lunar far side by the Yutu 2 rover and Chang'e 4 lander.

During the ceremony, agency leaders acknowledged the historical barriers that African-Americans and Blacks have faced at NASA and elsewhere, as well as the systemic inequalities that persist today for BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and people of color) communities. Jackson joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics\u00a0(NACA), the predecessor of NASA, during the height of segregation in the U.S. She became NASA's first Black engineer in 1958. She was unable to advance far in her career and instead used her energies to mentor other Black women to help them go even further than her, several NASA officials said.\u00a0 Related: Why 'Hidden Figures' is a movie everyone should watch  Her death in 2005 preceded the new interest in NASA's Black history spurred by the movie and book \"Hidden Figures,\" released in 2016, which finally brought a group of Black women who helped fuel NASA's early history into the spotlight. The renaming of The Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters building was announced in June 2020. \"There is no denying that she faced innumerable challenges in her world that would eventually help send the first Americans to space,\" acting administrator Steve Jurczyk said during the Feb. 26 ceremony in Washington, D.C., which was broadcast on NASA TV. He acknowledged \"heartfelt and genuine\" conversations that he and other NASA officials have had with the Black community since he took the role of acting administrator in January; those conversations \"have given me an appreciation for the challenges that Americans face, and what we need to do,\" he said/ Jurczyk added he is committed to continuing to address barriers for NASA employees of diverse backgrounds and that \"we're going to work on that for the rest of our lives.\" The ceremony, held with attendees in masks due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, included luminaries such as fellow \"Hidden Figure\" Christine Darden, Jackson's grandchildren, and artist Tenbeete Solomon, also known as Trap Bob. Numerous dignitaries, largely from the Black community, gave speeches or sent their best wishes or memories of Jackson through prerecorded video.  \"Her example will guide us together as we raise to new heights for the benefit of humankind,\" said Clayton Turner, director of NASA's\u00a0Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, which is roughly three hours south of the newly named NASA headquarters. Turner, who is Black, told attendees at the D.C. ceremony that Jackson \"used her success to help countless others to follow in her footsteps.\" Jackson graduated from Hampton Institute in Virginia in 1942 with a dual degree in math and physical sciences. After taking a job as a math teacher, she worked as a bookkeeper and served as a secretary for the Army before joining the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory (today, the Langley Research Center that Turner leads) in 1951. Jackson was subsequently recruited by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to work as a \"human computer\" in the segregated West Area Computing Unit at Langley. Her pioneering work in supersonic aircraft and commercial aircraft at NACA and NASA is still being referred to today, Jurczyk said. Jackson's granddaughter, Wanda Jackson, recalled talking to her grandmother about one of her major accomplishments: helping to design the space shuttle. The elder Jackson downplayed what she did. \"She never gloated about any of her accomplishments or anything she did. It was who she was, everyday life,\" Wanda Jackson said. The renaming ceremony concluded several weeks of programming at NASA to commemorate Black History Month. February also saw the launch of the\u00a0S.S.

The delay will push the company's first space tourist flights to 2022. Regarding the upcoming test flight, company officials cited needed technical changes to the vehicle revealed by the Dec. 12 aborted suborbital test flight of the vehicle, which was caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI), according to SpaceNews. Virgin Galactic officials said that EMI caused a flight computer to reboot at the same time that SpaceShipTwo's engine ignited. There were no injuries to the vehicle's two pilots during the aborted flight, and the vehicle landed safely. Related: How Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo works (infographic) After the incident, an investigation revealed that a new flight control computer system likely caused the increased EMI that triggered the abort. Virgin Galactic planned for a follow-up test flight to occur as early as Feb. 13. But after trying to fix the issue, company engineers noted continuing EMI issues and decided to once again delay, using the time to modify the computer that is creating the interference and test the new system before attempting another flight.\u00a0 \"We saw some of our sensor readings \u2014 pressures and temperatures, those kinds of things \u2014 show some unusual fluctuations, which let us know EMI was still present and maybe in systems we didn't initially anticipate,\" Virgin Galactic president Mike Moses said on the call, according to SpaceNews.\u00a0 Following these updates and testing with the new system, Virgin Galactic plans to get the vehicle off the ground for this test flight in May, followed by two more test flights. The first of those additional flights will hold only the two pilots, while the second will include Virgin Galactic employees riding along as test passengers in the vehicle's cabin. These test flights will be followed by a fourth flight for the Italian Air Force, which will carry research payloads along with payload specialists.\u00a0 The company expects these flights to take place this summer, Virgin Galactic CEO Michael Colglazier said on the call, according to SpaceNews.\u00a0 The company also announced on the call that it will be rolling out the next iteration of its suborbital vehicle, dubbed SpaceShip III, on March 30. Following this rollout, the company aims to start flight testing the vehicle in the summer, at the same time as SpaceShipTwo.\u00a0 \"The Future of the Fleet.

Despite the continued delays, for which representatives partially placed blame on the coronavirus pandemic, the company is excited about the year ahead.\u00a0 \"Looking ahead, we're focused on completing our test flight program, expanding our fleet of spaceships and motherships, and developing our unique and transformative customer experience,\" Colglazier said about the company's 2020 progress in a press release following the call.\u00a0"}, {"source": "space.com", "title": "Q&A: Private astronaut Richard Garriott set to dive to lowest point on Earth", "author": "Robert Z. Pearlman", "date": "26 February 2021", "fullarticle": "Richard Garriott thought he would have been there and back by now. The son of a NASA astronaut and a video game pioneer who funded his own trip to the International Space Station in 2008, Garriott was set to dive to Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, the lowest point on Earth, in June, just days after another space explorer, NASA's Kathy Sullivan, became the first astronaut and the first woman to do so. But then a call came the night before Garriott's departure. \"I was crushed because they had a major mechanical failure,\" Garriott told Space.com, \"nothing that was dangerous for the crew or the submarine, but it was an electrical system, a junction box on the exterior that they really wanted at 100% before they dove any more. So that meant taking the entire submarine and ship back to Hawaii to remanufacture a couple of parts and retest those couple of extra parts. And now we're back in business, so I'm going to be the first dive on this sequence.\" Photos: Private space traveler Richard Garriott, a 'man on a mission' Garriott is now scheduled to begin the 12-hour dive aboard the \"Limiting Factor,\" the first commercially certified full-ocean-depth deep submergence vehicle, on Monday (March 1). An avid adventurer and the president-elect of the venerable The Explorers Club, Garriott is set to become the first person to orbit Earth, travel to the deepest part of the ocean and traverse both poles of the planet. \"I have been to space and I've been to both the North and South poles. So even though Kathy beat me going space to deep, she has not been to both poles. So, I will be the first male to go space to deep, and the first person to go who has traversed Earth as well as the deep,\" Garriott said. \"Not that you have to agree that any of that matters, which of course, fundamentally, it doesn't really, but it's kind of fun.\" Space.com spoke with Garriott the night before he departed for the \"Pressure Drop,\" the surface-side modified U.S. Navy ship that will support his dive near Guam in the Western Pacific Ocean. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Space.com: Are you making the 12-hour dive alone? Richard Garriott: The total dive time is 12 hours. It's four hours to the bottom, four hours exploring the bottom and four hours to return to the surface. I'm diving with Victor Vescovo, who underwrote the build of the \"Limiting Factor\" and also served as Kathy Sullivan's pilot. I am also traveling with my exploration partner, a guy named Michael Dubno. He is a good friend of mine; we build automatons together. We've dangled over lava pits in Nicaragua, we have been to the North Pole together and now we're headed to the deep together.\u00a0 [Dubno will dive separately from Garriott, following him the bottom of the ocean a couple of days later, as currently scheduled.]  Space.com: You are not just going down to sightsee and set records. What do you have planned for the four hours you will be at the bottom? Garriott: We have a pretty heavy science regimen on our dive series. We have science that the team behind the ship, the \"Limiting Factor,\" has set up and then science that we are doing with some other university labs. The Mariana Trench is created by the collision between the Pacific plate and the Philippine Sea plate, with the Pacific plate being subducted below the Philippine plate. We're going to try to get a geological sample from both sides of the subduction zone because, first, they should be strikingly different geology and secondly, these are rocks that are about to disappear forever. So these should be ancient, well-protected samples from both plates. Then, in my trips to the Antarctic and the Arctic and hydrothermal vents and volcanoes, we have brought back samples in which we have found extremophile lifeforms. And so in the deep we expect to find right at the bottom of the trench what are called piezophiles, which are high-pressure extremophiles that have never been sampled down there. On this last summer dive series, they [the crewmembers] believe they saw bacterial mats, but they didn't have the ability to sample them. That's something that has been sort of my specialty with a lot of the exploring that I've done, so I'm very eager to try to get that sample back.\u00a0 And then also for the Scripps Institute, we're going to be looking for microplastics. This is something that Mike and I did when we took a bunch of young explorers to the North Pole and sadly found them everywhere. Scripps has studied every open environment, every natural environment and has found that all had microplastics. So with both deep-water samples, as well as deep-mud samples, we anticipate that we will find a significant load of plastics.\u00a0 In photos: Sea life thrives at otherworldly hydrothermal vent system  Space.com: Beyond that, you have also planned some activities on the opposite end of the spectrum, the arts. Is that correct? Garriott: In fact, it is actually one of the things that I'm weirdly most excited about and which has been wildly successful.\u00a0 Like I did when I flew in space, we're taking lots of questions from kids. The kids are putting in pictures that I'm going to take into the deep and stamp them and answer the questions and then bring them all back and send it back to those kids.\u00a0 Then we also had the director of the National Association for Teaching English, who suggested a fascinating challenge and that was to ask kids to think about this trip and about the extreme environment and the tiny little 1.5-meter [5-foot] titanium sphere that we will be sitting in and think about the fact that because of the extremes of this environment, we can't take anything in that little sphere with us that is not absolutely essential for life support or science.\u00a0 And so he said, why don't we have kids write a poem called a cinquain, which is a five-line poem of only 22 syllables and a very specific number of syllables per line \u2014 two, four, six, eight, two, to be specific. And that way, they have to think very carefully about not just every word that goes into it, but literally every syllable that you put into this little poem.\u00a0 So we put out a challenge for kids to do this, and not only have we received now hundreds and hundreds from all over Europe, but also all over the United States and all over Asia and all the way down to New Zealand. Really from all over.\u00a0 I'm taking them all down with me and when we get back to the surface, I'll stamp them all with a Challenger Deep stamp and sent them all back. Space.com: Are you taking any personal items with you? Do you have anything that previously traveled with you to the poles and to space that you're now taking down to Challenger Deep? Garriott: There actually is one thing that I'm taking that has been all those places, which is a children's book that I have taken with me on all of my explorations since I was young. It's titled \"Hubert's Hair Raising Adventure\" and I actually took it on my first safaris in Africa when I was just out of college. I took it up to space and I took it to both poles. And now I will be taking it to the deep as well. I also have a Lego submarine that I made when I was about eight years old. I super glued it together because I was using it in the bathtub. It's made so I could put batteries and a motor in it and I could drive it around in my bathtub. So that was something I really had to take with me and my cinquain goes: My sub Once was Lego Now it's titanium From bathtub to Challenger Deep We dive.  Space.com: That's awesome. Anything else you're taking? Garriott: We actually created a couple of personal experiments that I think are really quite interesting. There is a concept called hydroforming where they use water pressure, usually with an explosive behind it, to basically mint a coin in a sense. So we thought, well, we're going to have natural pressure on the outside [of the submersible] that is monstrous, so why don't we make a die like you might stamp a coin with and we'll put a thin sheet of metal across the surface of it, and we'll let the natural water pressure at the depths form the thin metal around the die.\u00a0 So we're taking this 3-inch-diameter [7.6 centimeters], two-sided die with these clamp rings on it that we can put 10 sheets of brass or copper on and hopefully hydroform. We're going to send that down on every dive in our series and hope to come back with these little minted things we've created with natural pressure. And then, after setting the highest geocache in the world, which is on the International Space Station, we're going to set the deepest one.\u00a0 We've cut a 6-inch-square [15 cm] titanium plate that not only has the geocache number written on it, which is still hidden until we make it public in a week or so, and it has a secret word written on it. And we have a syntactic foam float that rises up on a Kevlar tether, which also has the word \"geocache\" and the geocache number on it.\u00a0 Then, on the opposite sides of the syntactic foam, which is kind of a downward facing arrow, is the secret word. And so the secret word is in four places on this thing. So that way, anybody that happens to see this again in the future therefore will have seen the secret word and will have a chance to find this geocache as well. Space.com: Lastly, have you spoken to Kathy Sullivan? Did she share any advice given her own dive and your shared spaceflight experience? Garriott: Kathy's advice was invaluable. In addition to the scientific and human aspects and observational aspects of the trip, I had some really practical questions, like you're sitting in a chair for 12 hours and that's a similar length of time that we had to sit in a space capsule in a spacesuit without having to move. And there's these little things like in the space capsule that you wear an adult diaper just for this occasion. So we covered all kinds of important subjects.

Related: Astronaut-led video tour reveals details in 'For All Mankind' moon base Spoiler warning: What follows contains minor spoilers for \"The Bleeding Edge,\" Episode 2 in Season 2 of \"For All Mankind.\" \"So I'm poring through the script for episode two and I see there's a character in there named 'Garrett Reisman' and I wasn't sure what that meant,\" Reisman said. \"Maybe they were just going to name a character after me as a nice nod and have that character be played by a professional actor.\" But Reisman noticed that the part wasn't very big; it was nothing like the extended scenes that portrayed Mercury astronaut Deke Slayton in the first season or European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Wubbo Ockels as seen in the first episode of Season 2. Suspecting something was up, Reisman reached out to the show's executive producers. \"'Hey, I see this character, 'astronaut Garrett Reisman.' Where are you possibly going to find an actor handsome enough to play that role?'\" joked Reisman, he recalled. As it turns out, they already had the perfect candidate for the part. collectSPACE.com spoke with the real-life astronaut Garrett Reisman about his cameo appearance in \"For All Mankind,\" now streaming on Apple TV+. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  collectSPACE (cS): Had you asked for a cameo, or whose idea was it to insert you, as you, into the show? Garrett Reisman: It was something that executive producers Ben Nedivi and Matt Wolpert just decided to do. I think in Season 1 there was a thought about putting my name on a mission patch, but they said, \"No, no, we've got a better idea. We're going to do something in Season 2.\" Ben and Matt wrote the script for Episode 2, so I'm pretty sure it was their idea to throw me in front of the camera, which I told them was a horrible, horrible mistake. cS: You play the commander of space shuttle Columbia, ferrying Ockels (Bj\u00f8rn Alexander), Ellen Wilson (Jodi Balfour) and Molly Cobb (Sonya Walger) home from the Jamestown moon base. What was it like playing a space shuttle astronaut, given you launched twice on the real shuttle? [Reisman logged more than 100 days in space flying on two missions, including a stay on board the International Space Station in 2008.] Reisman: It was funny. I remember after one cut, Matt Wolpert came up to me and said, \"You know, I'm just not believing it. You don't seem like a real astronaut.\" People go to Space Camp so that they can pretend that they're an astronaut for a bit. Well, I kind of got to go to acting camp and pretend like I'm an actor, and it was just as much fun as I think it is for the people who go to Space Camp, for the same reasons. In Friday's episode, I have a line which is basically preparing for the OMS [orbital maneuvering system] burn and some technical callouts with Jody Balfour, who plays astronaut Ellen Wilson. She's sitting in the pilot seat, I'm in the commander's seat and we're going through this procedure and I have to turn around and tell Molly Cobb [Walger] to put her seatbelt on.  And we shot that \u2014 but what you have to understand is that when you shoot a scene, even if is only to use a few seconds, it took the better part of an afternoon to get it done because you have to do it over and over again. You have to do it with the cameras in one position to get the wide shot and then bring the cameras in for close-ups and then the reaction shots. In the process, you have to take the set apart and pull out the payload bay for the close-up shots, and then you have to put it all back together again. So it takes the better part of the day for this one scene. So we are doing it over and over and the entire time we are doing it, Cobb is supposed to be in zero-g, so Sonya [Walger] is in a harness with wires holding her up and it is terribly uncomfortable. So she's stuck there every time. Now, I'm proud to say that for the dozen times we shot that scene, I nailed my line every single time \u2014 expect once. And the one time I flubbed, Sonya was still up there in the wires, this was near the end of the day, and she looks at me, shakes her finger at me and says, \"You know Reisman? You have one damn line!\" And I just started cracking up, it was so funny. I said to her it was not my fault because who talks like this? Who wrote this? And because my line is a bunch of technobabble, it was lines that I wrote [as the technical consultant]. So I actually wrote the line. Related: A real-life astronaut taught Brad Pitt how to fly a spaceship for 'Ad Astra'  cS: You mention the set, how close to the real shuttle flight deck was the mockup that you filmed in? Reisman: Our set was used for some other production, they didn't build it just for the show. It looked pretty realistic. Let me put it to you this way: the switches were all in the right place. So if I needed to turn off GPC 1 [General Purpose Computer 1] I knew exactly where to reach for that switch. But the look and feel was a little bit different than the real thing. If you got up close and really looked at it, the main difference was that it was made out of plywood, so you could take it apart. Everything from behind the commander and pilot seats decoupled and separated into two pieces so you could shoot over the commander's or pilot's shoulders and then put it back together again. And not every window had glass in it, so you could shoot through the windows. And the seats, I don't know where they got them, but they were quite different from the ones we used on the shuttle. But keep in mind this is an alternate universe, so who knows? cS: Is the flight suit you wore in the episode one of the flight suits you wore while at NASA or in space? Reisman: That's a good question. I offered to bring my own and they told me no, because it might be slightly different from what the others were wearing. The more important thing was that it matched everybody else, not how authentic it was. So they said no. I did get a flight suit for one scene that was the standard blue flight suit like we had at NASA. I looked at the label and it was from the same manufacturer. I was even able to give them the size off of my actual flight suit and they went out and bought one from the very same company that makes the NASA flight suits. I think I did wear my own flight boots. That might have been my only contribution.  cS: What about the checklist you have in the scene. Was that something you had loaned to the production? Reisman: The checklist was not mine, but it was based on mine. At one point, Jaime Mengual, who is in charge of our props, he came down to my house and I brought out all my stuff from the attic. So I had all my checklists, my knee board, some space food and my flight suits. He looked at all of it and he took detailed photos. He even took the checklists and scanned them. So the checklist I was using was a prop, but it was based on a scan of my actual checklist. And if anybody wants to know the procedure I'm executing and reading from, it is actually an OMS [orbital maneuvering system] delta V [change in velocity] burn procedure from the shuttle OMS burns. cS: You mentioned earlier about the idea of putting your name on one of the show's fictional mission patches and with this cameo, that happened. There is a space shuttle Columbia patch with your name on it. Did you have a hand in its design? Reisman: No, that was all done separately by graphic designer Evan Regester. I don't even have one of my patches. I didn't get to keep my costumes. I know you can buy it, so maybe I should get one myself. cS: This is your second cameo, not only on a show, but on one created by Ronald D. Moore. How did your \"For All Mankind\" experience differ from your walk-on role in the last episode of \"Battlestar Galactica\"? Reisman: \"Battlestar Galactica\" was an absolute spur-of-the-moment, impromptu thing. Ron invited me to visit the set while they were filming the last episode of the very last season and while I was there they asked, \"Hey, you want to be a colonial Marine?\" And so they sent me over the wardrobe and got me all kitted out and then I was in the back of a Raptor during a scene where the Raptor gets blown to smithereens. So my character didn't last very long. I mean, it's like a single frame. Now with \"For All Mankind,\" I have really come up in the world because in this episode on Friday, my official credit is actually \"guest star,\" which is another funny thing. My wife has been giving me a really hard time about it. She's like, \"A guest star? So you're like what, like Charo or Red Buttons on \"The Love Boat\"? I guess you have to be above a certain age to get that joke, but she teases me mercilessly about it. In reality, it's very minor, I have one line, so it is very much tongue in cheek when I say I am a \"guest star.\" \"The Bleeding Edge,\" Episode 2 in Season 2 of \"For All Mankind,\" is available now on Apple TV+. A new episode is released every Friday on the streaming service."}, {"source": "space.com", "title": "'Harbor Seal Rock' on Mars and other new sights intrigue Perseverance rover scientists", "author": "Mike Wall", "date": "26 February 2021", "fullarticle": " NASA's Perseverance rover has landed in a rich scientific hunting ground, if its first good look around is any guide. The car-sized Perseverance landed on the floor of Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, kicking off an ambitious surface mission that will hunt for signs of ancient Mars life and collect samples for future return to Earth, among other tasks. Perseverance is not yet ready to dive into that science work; the mission team is still conducting health and status checks on its various instruments and subsystems. But the six-wheeled robot recently used its Mastcam-Z camera suite to capture a high-definition, 360-degree panorama of its surroundings, and that first taste has the mission team intrigued. Live updates: NASA's Perseverance Mars rover mission Join our forums here to discuss the Perseverance rover on Mars. What do you hope finds? For example, the zoomable panorama revealed a dark stone that the team has dubbed \"Harbor Seal Rock,\" Mastcam-Z principal investigator Jim Bell, of Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration, said during a webcast discussion of the photo on Thursday (Feb. 25). The Martian wind probably carved Harbor Seal Rock into its curious shape over the eons, Bell said. He also pointed out patches that showed evidence of much faster-acting erosion \u2014 spots where the thrusters on Perseverance's \"sky crane\" descent stage blew away Mars' blanket of red dust on Feb. 18, exposing the surfaces of small rocks.\u00a0 One such patch harbors a group of light-colored, heavily pitted stones that have caught mission scientists' eyes. \"Are these volcanic rocks? Are these carbonate rocks? Are these something else? Do they have coatings on them?\" Bell said. \"We don't know \u2014\u00a0we don't have any chemical data or mineral data on them yet \u2014\u00a0but, boy, they're certainly interesting, and part of the story about what's going on here is going to be told when we get more detailed information on these rocks and some of the other materials in this area.\" This is one of the key jobs of Mastcam-Z and Perseverance's other cameras, Bell said \u2014 to spot interesting features that Perseverance can study in more detail with its spectrometers and other science instruments. The 28-mile-wide (45 kilometers) Jezero Crater harbored a deep lake and a river delta billions of years ago. Deltas are good at preserving signs of life here on Earth, so the Perseverance team is eager for the rover to study and sample the remnants of that feature within Jezero. And the delta is visible in the Mastcam-Z panorama; the cliffs that mark its edge are about 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) from Perseverance's landing site, Bell said. The ridgeline that's visible beyond the delta cliffs in the Mastcam-Z panorama is Jezero Crater's rim, he added. The recently unveiled photo is just the beginning, of course. For starters, it's the lowest-resolution panorama the Mastcam-Z team will construct. Bell said that similar shots that are three times sharper will be assembled after Perseverance switches over to its surface-optimized software, a four-day process that's already underway. And we haven't gotten the slightest taste of Perseverance's science discoveries yet. That work will take a while to get going, because the mission team's first big task after getting the rover up and running is to conduct test flights of the 4-lb. (1.8 kilograms) Mars Helicopter Ingenuity, which rode to the Red Planet on Perseverance's belly. Ingenuity's pioneering sorties \u2014 the first rotorcraft flights on a world beyond Earth \u2014\u00a0will likely take place this spring, and science and sampling are expected to begin in earnest in the summer, mission team members have said."}, {"source": "space.com", "title": "Cosmologists create 4,000 virtual universes to solve Big Bang mystery", "author": "Stephanie Pappas", "date": "26 February 2021", "fullarticle": "Cosmologists are pressing rewind on the first instant after the Big Bang by simulating 4,000 versions of the universe on a massive supercomputer.\u00a0 The goal is to paint a picture of the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang, when the observable universe suddenly expanded 1 trillion trillion times in size in the tiniest sliver of a microsecond. By applying the method used for the simulations to real observations of today's universe, researchers hope to arrive at an accurate understanding of what this inflationary period looked like.\u00a0 \"We are trying to do something like guessing a baby photo of our universe from the latest picture,\" study leader Masato Shirasaki, a cosmologist at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), wrote in an email to Live Science.\u00a0 Today's universe shows variations in density, with some patches rich in galaxies and others relatively barren. One promising hypothesis for this uneven distribution of visible matter is that, at the time of the Big Bang, there were already quantum fluctuations, or random, temporary changes in energy, in the tiny, primordial universe, Shirasaki said.\u00a0 When the universe expanded, these fluctuations would have expanded, too, with denser points stretching into regions of greater density than their surroundings. Gravitational forces would have interacted with these stretched-out filaments, causing galaxies to clump along them.\u00a0 But gravitational interactions are complex, so trying to rewind this inflationary period to understand how the universe would have looked before it is very challenging. Cosmologists essentially need to remove the gravitational fluctuations from the equation.\u00a0 The researchers developed a reconstruction method to do just that. To find out if the reconstruction was accurate, though, they needed some way to test it. So they used NAOJ's ATERUI II supercomputer to create 4,000 versions of the universe, all with slightly different initial density fluctuations. The researchers allowed these virtual universes to undergo their own virtual inflations and then applied the reconstruction method to them, to see if it could get them back to their original starting points. \u00a0 \u2014 7 far-out discoveries about the universe's beginning \u2014 What is the Big Bang theory? \u2014 From Big Bang to present: Snapshots of our universe through time\u00a0 The results, published Jan. 4 in the journal Physical Review D, were promising. \"We find that a reconstruction method can reduce the gravitational effects on observed galaxy distributions, allowing us to extract the information of initial conditions of our universe in an efficient way,\" Shirasaki said. The reconstruction has been applied to real-world galaxy data before, he added, but the new study shows that it can work on the universe's inflation period, too. The next step, Shirasaki said, is to apply the reconstruction to real observations of the cosmic web. Those observations have already been made by a telescope in New Mexico as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey."}, {"source": "space.com", "title": "Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin won't launch its 1st New Glenn rocket until late 2022", "author": "Mike Wall", "date": "26 February 2021", "fullarticle": "We'll have to wait another year to see Blue Origin's giant orbital rocket get off the ground. Blue Origin, which is run by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, announced today (Feb. 25) that it's pushing the target date for the debut launch of its heavy-lift New Glenn rocket from late 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022. \"This updated maiden flight target follows the recent Space Force decision to not select New Glenn for the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 Launch Services Procurement (LSP),\" Blue Origin representatives wrote in an update today.\n\nRelated: NASA taps Blue Origin's New Glenn to launch future missions Blue Origin and Northrop Grumman lost out to SpaceX and United Launch Alliance in that national-security launch decision, which the Space Force announced in August 2020. New Glenn is a two-stage rocket that stands 322 feet tall (98 meters) and is named after NASA astronaut John Glenn, who in February 1962 became the first American to circle Earth. (Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was the first person overall, pulling off the feat in April 1961.)\u00a0 The rocket will be capable of launching 50 tons (45 metric tons) to low Earth orbit when it's up and running, according to its specifications page. Bezos has said he hopes New Glenn will fly people as well as payloads. Each New Glenn first stage will be capable of launching 25 missions, Blue Origins representatives say. Shortly after liftoff, the booster will come back to Earth and land on a ship at sea, as we've already seen the first stages of SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets do. Such reuse is key to Blue Origin's overall vision, which involves helping humanity extend its footprint out into the final frontier. For example, the company's New Shepard rocket-capsule combo, which is designed to take people and payloads to suborbital space, is fully reusable. One New Shepard vehicle has flown seven uncrewed test flights, acing its landing each time. (New Shepard is not yet operational, but its first crewed spaceflights could happen soon.) Blue Origin continues to make good progress on New Glenn and its launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, company representatives wrote in today's update. The company has already scored New Glenn launch contracts with Eutelsat, Mu Space, OneWeb, Sky Perfect JSAT and Telesat, as Space News noted. And NASA recently made New Glenn eligible to compete for contracts under the agency's Launch Services II program, which applies to launches through December 2027. \"New Glenn is proceeding to fulfill its current commercial contracts, pursue a large and growing commercial market, and enter into new civil space launch contracts,\" Blue Origin representatives wrote in today's update. \"We hope to launch NSSL payloads in the future, and remain committed to serving the U.S. national defense mission.\""}, {"source": "space.com", "title": "50 years ago, an Apollo 14 astronaut played golf on the moon. Here's the inside story.", "author": "Elizabeth Howell", "date": "26 February 2021", "fullarticle": "Most golfers really want to avoid sand traps, but NASA astronaut Alan Shepard had no choice but to deal with one when wielding a six-iron head on the moon's dusty surface 50 years ago this month. Shepard took a few moments during the Apollo 14 landing to show off his hobby during a live broadcast from the lunar surface on Feb. 6, 1971. He took two shots, with the second ball going \"miles and mile,\" he said on-camera.\u00a0 He was exaggerating, according to new analysis from the United States Golf Association (USGA). Based on data from the crew and a modern-day moon mission, the group found that the first ball traveled 24 yards (22 meters) and the second about 40 yards (37 m). By comparison, a 2019 report using golf tournaments' gender categories shows that an average amateur male golfer on Earth can drive the ball 216 yards (198 m), and an average female golfer 148 yards (135 m), although those distances have increased significantly since Shepard's flight.\u00a0 Related: Apollo 14: NASA's 'rookie' astronauts bring golf to the moon (photos) To be fair to Shepard, however, he had more obstacles to contend with than your typical Sunday hobbyist. His golf \"club\" was actually a modified sample collection device with the head attached to the end. He was also wearing a notoriously stiff spacesuit that forced him to swing with a single arm.\u00a0 \"You can only get a one-handed shot, which really doesn't give you the strength and speed of a normal golf shot on Earth,\" USGA historian Victoria Nenno told Space.com. \"You normally have a lot of turn [at the waist], and strength coming from legs. Unfortunately, Shepard was only able to manage a one-handed shot.\" In contrast, Nenno said, Earth-bound golfers have enjoyed technical advances like moisture-wicking technology in clothing, that Shepard would not have had access to in the 1970s, even on his home planet. For that reason, she added she was intrigued to hear of newer, more flexible moon spacesuits NASA is creating for the Artemis program for possible landings in 2024. \"It would be very interesting to see how that would affect the shot,\" Nenno said.  USGA found the lunar golf balls in high-resolution, enhanced scans of the original flight footage of the Apollo 14 mission. The association measured the point between divot and locations where the balls ended up using high-resolution images from orbit taken by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched in 2009. The association used a second technique to confirm the measurements. Some of the images used were photo sequences taken from the lunar module, the astronauts' landing craft, taken to show the entire landing site to geologists on Earth. USGA stitched the photographs into a panorama to demonstrate the location of the divot and the two balls, which (after taking the new photo enhancements into account) were well within view of the landed spacecraft.\u00a0 The two balls are also visible in Apollo 14 takeoff footage, but only after applying \"a complex stacking technique on multiple separate frames,\" according to a USGA Golf Journal story. This means NASA astronauts Shepard and Ed Mitchell likely couldn't have seen the balls themselves from the spacecraft, either during their time on the ground or when flying away from the moon. Happily for golf fans, Shepard found room to tuck away his modified club in the lunar module; that was lucky given that astronauts often discarded equipment on the moon to make room for precious rock samples. The rules surrounding giving space artifacts to astronauts were different in the 1970s, so Shepard kept the club before donating it to the USGA Museum in Liberty Corner, New Jersey, roughly an hour west of New York City, in 1974. Shepard was convinced to part with his precious moon club after the famed singer and entertainer Bing Crosby, a member of the USGA committee in 1972, wrote Shepard saying the museum would be \"an ideal repository for the celebrated implement,\" Nenno said. Shepard and Crosby were already acquainted from playing together at Pebble Beach, California, a well-known golf haven for enthusiasts. Nenno said the artifact is typically one of the most popular in the museum \u2014 not taking into account the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and associated quarantine rules, of course, which have affected tourist destinations worldwide. \"The Apollo program represented national pride and hope for the future. The artifact has a lot of those great feelings attached to it; the look of it is unusual and interesting compared to other golf equipment,\" she explained. Why \"unusual and interesting\"? Technically speaking, the golf club was a Wilson Staff Dyna-Power 6-iron head attached to a sampling tool \u2014 a five-piece tool loosely held together by string when not fully assembled \u2014 that was made of aluminum and Teflon. Golf clubs usually don't come apart as Shepard's moon club did, but Shepard needed the modification to fold it into the cramped quarters of the Apollo lunar lander. Shepard got the idea for his golf moonshot in 1970, when famed golfer Bob Hope visited NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC, now Johnson Space Center) in Houston, the training hub for astronauts, for a television special. Hope took his golf club everywhere, according to the USGA, and Shepard was inspired to do a quick golf session on the moon to demonstrate the moon's gravitational pull, which is one-sixth that of Earth, according to NASA. Shepard, the commander of Apollo 14 and a long-time NASA astronaut, used his connections to discreetly ask for help keeping the plan a surprise. Jack Harden, the pro at River Oaks Country Club in Houston, made the clubhead. NASA's technical services division also assisted with the golf \"club\" construction, which had to meet the same strict safety requirements as other spacecraft payloads.\u00a0 Shepard also made sure to clear his golf shot with senior management, approaching then-MSC director Bob Gilruth to get buy-in. At first, Shepard recalled in a 1998 NASA oral history, Gilruth said \"there was absolutely no way.\" Shepard, however, explained the golf club's construction to Gilruth and then made the director a promise.  \"The thing that finally convinced Bob was when I said, 'Boss, I\u2019ll make a deal with you. If we have screwed up, if we have had equipment failure, anything has gone wrong on the surface where you are embarrassed or we are embarrassed, I will not do it. I will not be so frivolous,'\" said Shepard at the time. \"I want to wait until the very end of the mission, stand in front of the television camera, whack these golf balls with this makeshift club, fold it up, stick it in my pocket, climb up the ladder, and close the door, and we\u2019ve gone,\" Shepard said. \"So he finally said, 'Okay.' And that\u2019s the way it happened.\" Like any good astronaut, Shepard simulated his golf shot long before making it to the moon. He would regularly haul his more than 200-lb. (90 kilograms) spacesuit to a local bunker to practice his shot while suited up, away from the public eye, just to make sure he could land it, USGA said. Decades after the historic golf excursion, Shepard still had pride in the accomplishment. \"So far I'm the only person to have hit a golf ball on the moon. Probably will be for some time,\" he told NASA in the February 1998 oral history, a few months before his death at age 74. He marveled at how different an experience was golfing on the lunar surface. \"What a neat place to whack a golf ball.\""}, {"source": "space.com", "title": "NASA's Perseverance rover on Mars is carrying an adorable 'family portrait' of Martian rovers", "author": "Hanneke Weitering", "date": "25 February 2021", "fullarticle": "NASA's Perseverance rover has brought the \"family portrait\" bumper sticker fad to a whole new world.\u00a0 Raw images from the Perseverance rover, which safely landed on the surface of Mars last Thursday (Feb. 18), have revealed a small plaque featuring a lineup of little spacecraft.\u00a0 At first glance, the small white decals may look like pixelated cats marching across the rover's deck.

But in anticipation of that milestone, scientists are wondering whether the Tianwen-1 rover may carry Earthly contamination with it to the surface. Because scientists have high hopes of someday discovering traces of life on Mars, spacecraft that will land on the planet are kept as immaculately free of Earthly life as possible. These days, that means a complicated cleaning procedure throughout the spacecraft's assembly and frequent testing for spores, an inactive form of bacteria that are particularly hardy.\u00a0 NASA's Perseverance rover went through precisely that treatment before it left Earth in July for its journey to Mars. However, Congress bans NASA from communicating with its Chinese counterpart. \"I don't know anything beyond what all the rest of us know from the public releases of information, but they do participate,\" Lisa Pratt, NASA's planetary protection officer, told a virtual meeting of the committee leading the creation of a new decadal survey identifying the priorities of planetary scientists into the 2030s on Feb. 11. Related: China's Tianwen-1 Mars mission in photos If the Tianwen-1 mission successfully touches down on Mars, China will become only the second country to operate a spacecraft on the Red Planet's surface, joining NASA. (The Soviet Union and the European Space Agency have had spacecraft on the surface, but these missions either crashed or failed in less than a minute.) Like the U.S., China is party to the Outer Space Treaty, established in 1967, which outlines what nations can and cannot do in outer space \u2014 yes to working for all humanity, no to nuclear weapons, for example. One tenet of the Outer Space Treaty refers to planetary protection, stating that countries must explore other worlds \"so as to avoid their harmful contamination.\" There are a few reasons to be wary of bringing terrestrial bugs to other worlds. For one, scientists don't want any Earth creatures to be able to make a home for themselves on Mars; for another, scientists want to be confident that if they detect traces of life on Mars, that sign is indeed from Mars, not some wayward fingerprint that came from Earth. According to previous reporting by Space.com, Tianwen-1 is targeting a landing in Utopia Planitia, at a site where there's no evidence of water ice near the surface. (When it comes to planetary protection, sites with water are always scientists' top concern.) Long ago, however, there may have been ancient groundwater deep below the surface and mudflows in Tianwen-1's landing zone. NASA's Viking 2 and InSight landers both touched down elsewhere in this same region. The twin Viking landers were the first spacecraft that NASA engineers sampled before departure, archiving organic and biological material from them so that if instruments detected a potential signal of life, scientists could compare such data to the samples remaining on Earth. Launched in the 1970s, the Viking mission still predated NASA's earnest planetary protection standards for Mars. But InSight landed in 2018 and was required to meet specific standards before launch of just how dirty the spacecraft could be, with engineers searching for and tallying exposed surfaces in the spacecraft for spores. Spore-counting is a standard NASA would like to move away from, as it turns out, but potential future techniques, including those relying on genetic analysis, aren't ready yet, Pratt said. So spores it is. And China is likely in the same place, Pratt said, noting that Chinese scientists do have contacts with a key Italian planetary protection team, so should be aware of current standards.\u00a0 However, while NASA and its Chinese counterpart can't interact directly, sometimes their representatives end up at the same meetings, and Pratt told the story of just such an occasion, which she attributed to November, when she ended up seated next to a Chinese scientists. \"I asked a question in front of everybody, I said, 'Can you talk to us about what you did for planetary protection compliance?'\" Pratt told the committee. \"And the individual sort of said, 'We did what all the rest of you do, we did the spore metric measurements, and we were highly compliant.'\" NASA, however, hasn't seen those measurements and may never. \"They at least said the right thing. Needless to say, there is no inspection, no external verification,\" Pratt said. \"At the moment, my thought is, 'OK, I'm taking their word for it,' because I don't have any way to know otherwise.\""}, {"source": "space.com", "title": "NASA's Parker Solar Probe captures stunning Venus photo during close flyby", "author": "Meghan Bartels", "date": "25 February 2021", "fullarticle": "NASA's Parker Solar Probe nailed its fourth swing past Venus on Feb. 20, and mission scientists celebrated by releasing a stunning image captured during a similar maneuver in July.

And while Parker Solar Probe is tailored to studying the sun, if a spacecraft has to loop past our \"evil twin\" planet anyway, might as well turn the instruments on, the team figured. On July 11, 2020, the spacecraft was conducting its third Venus flyby, zooming 7,693 miles (12,380 kilometers) away from the planet, according to a NASA statement. During the maneuver, the team switched on the spacecraft's Wide-field Imager for Parker Solar Probe (WISPR) instrument to take a peek at Venus \u2014 with stunning results. Related: A string of planets sparkle in photos from 3 different sun probes  WISPR is designed to capture distant, visible-light images of phenomena surrounding the sun, like the solar wind that constantly shoots charged particles out from the sun across the solar system or the coronal mass ejections that vomit blobs of matter into space, according to NASA. So this isn't your typical planetary glamor shot: there is no color, no intricate clouds, no cosmic crispness. But it's a fascinating view of Earth's neighbor, and one that scientists are still parsing, according to the NASA release. The bright rim around Venus' edge may be light from individual oxygen atoms in the planet's upper atmosphere pairing up, creating what's known as nightglow since it occurs on the shadowed side of the planet. The streaks that can be seen crossing the image also offer a puzzle. Some may be the traces of cosmic rays while some may be dust reflecting sunlight into the camera and some may be tiny particles from the spacecraft itself, flung off by impacting dust. But the real highlight is Venus itself, which looks nothing like what scientists expected to see with WISPR. \"WISPR is tailored and tested for visible light observations,\" Angelos Vourlidas, the WISPR project scientist from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Maryland said in the statement. \"We expected to see clouds, but the camera peered right through to the surface.\" Specifically, the instrument captured differences in surface temperature on Venus. The dark blob in the center of the image of the planet is a massive highland region that scientists call Aphrodite Terra. Here, scientists know that the rock is cooler, by about 85 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) compared to nearby regions, according to NASA. WISPR seeing this temperature difference could mean that something strange is happening in Venus' thick atmosphere that's allowing the instrument to see through the clouds. Or, it could mean that WISPR can actually pick up some near-infrared light it wasn't technically designed to see, which could create new opportunities for observing the spacecraft's primary target, the sun. \"Either way,\" Vourlidas said, \"some exciting science opportunities await us.\" To determine which scenario is at play, WISPR took similar photographs during Parker Solar Probe's fourth Venus flyby, which took place on Feb. 20. At the time of closest approach, at 3:05 p.m. EST (2005 GMT), the spacecraft came within 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of the Venusian surface, according to a NASA statement. However, those images won't make it to Earth until late April. The spacecraft's next milestone will be a close approach to the sun on April 29; its next Venus flyby is scheduled for Oct. 16."}, {"source": "space.com", "title": "Company plans to start building private Voyager space station with artificial gravity in 2025", "author": "Jeff Spry", "date": "25 February 2021", "fullarticle": "Orbital Assembly Corporation (OAC) recently unveiled new details about its ambitious Voyager Station, which is projected to be the first commercial space station operating with artificial gravity. OAC, a manufacturing firm centered on the colonization of space, discussed Voyager Station during a video press junket late last month. The Jan. 29 \"First Assembly\" virtual event served as an update for interested investors, marketing partners and enthusiastic vacationers hoping to someday book a room aboard the rotating Voyager Station. The project's roots go back a number of years.\u00a0 In pictures: Private space stations of the future John Blincow established The Gateway Foundation in 2012. The organization's plans include jumpstarting and sustaining a robust and thriving space construction industry, first with the Voyager Station and The Gateway commercial space station \u2014 \"important first steps to colonizing space and other worlds,\" the foundation's website states. OAC was founded by the Gateway Foundation team in 2018 as a way to help make these dreams come true.\u00a0 The hour-long Jan. 29 presentation and Q&A session was hosted by OAC medical advisor Shawna Pandya and streamed live on the company's YouTube channel. During the event, the space construction company revealed its schedule for the next chapter of human space exploration.\u00a0 Its team of skilled NASA veterans, pilots, engineers and architects intends to assemble a \"space hotel\" in low Earth orbit that rotates fast enough to generate artificial gravity for vacationers, scientists, astronauts educators and anyone else who wants to experience off-Earth living. As a multi-phase endeavor requiring funds to realize the dream, OAC is now officially open for private investors to purchase a stake in the company at $0.25 per share, until April 1, 2021.\u00a0 Voyager Station is patterned after concepts imagined by legendary rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, one of the main orchestrators of NASA's Apollo program. The 650-foot-wide (200 meters) wheel-shaped habitat will spin with an angular velocity high enough to create moon-like levels of artificial gravity for occupants. Lunar legacy: 45 Apollo moon mission photos If realized, Voyager would become the biggest human-made structure in space, fully equipped to accommodate up to 400 people. Assembly is scheduled to begin around 2025, Gateway Foundation representatives said.\u00a0 This shining technological ring will feature amenities ranging from themed restaurants, viewing lounges, movie theaters and concert venues to bars, libraries, gyms, and a health spa. Voyager will house 24 integrated habitation modules, each of which will be 65 feet long and 40 feet wide (20 by 12 meters). At near-lunar gravity, the rotating resort will have functional toilets, showers, and allow jogging and jumping in fun and novel ways. But before the station can start spinning, its builders must establish the necessary orbital infrastructure and create smaller structures to test the concept.\u00a0 Blincow explained during the Jan. 29 event that the current plan is to build the rotating space station in stages, beginning with a small-scale prototype station, in addition to a free-flying microgravity facility, both using Voyager components.\u00a0 \"This will be the next industrial revolution,\" Blincow said. Eventually, a Structure Truss Assembly Robot (STAR) will fabricate the frame of the Voyager and Gateway stations in orbit. Prior to that happening, however, a smaller, ground-based prototype, known as DSTAR, will test the technology here on Earth.\u00a0 OAC's truss assembly robot stands to be the first to build a space station in low Earth orbit and will serve as \"the structural backbone of future projects in space,\" OAC fabrication manager Tim Clements said during the event.\u00a0 Currently, the machine is undergoing commissioning and shipping. It will then be completed and tested in California. \"The prototype will produce a truss section roughly 300 feet [90 m] in length in under 90 minutes,\" Clements revealed during the live-streamed event. \"DSTAR weighs almost 8 tons in mass, consisting of steel, electrical and mechanical components.\" OAC is also creating a robotic observer drone for remote viewing via a virtual reality headset as its first in-house development project.\u00a0 \"It's going to be our eyes on the job site,\" said Tim Alatorre, Gateway Foundation executive team member one of the station's designers. \"The observer drone operates in a support function. It can perch on existing craft. It can also be fully reusable and can fly and have a free-flight mode on extended missions.\" Long before Voyager Station can start accommodating guests, OAC needs to test both building a station in low Earth orbit and prove the viability of stable artificial gravity in space. The company plans to construct a prototype gravity ring that will measure 200 feet (61 m) in diameter and will be engineered to spin up to create artificial gravity near Mars' level, which is about 40% that of Earth. \"The gravity ring is going to be a key technology demonstration project that we plan to build, assemble and operate in low Earth orbit in just a few years' time,\" said OAC co-founder Jeff Greenblatt. \"The company also plans to use an orbital version of the DSTAR called the PSTAR, which stands for Prototype Structural Truss Assembly Robot.\" This gravity ring will act as a \"near-term demonstrator,\" which will take two to three years to build and launch. Once installed in orbit, its assembly will take just three days. This structure will act as the company\u2019s test base for many of the technologies to be used to build Voyager Station. \"We haven't seen an explosion of commercial activity in space,\" Alatorre said. \"The cost has been about $8,000 per kilogram [$3,600 per lb.] for a long time. But with the Falcon 9, you can do it for less than $2,000. And as Starship comes online, it will only cost a few hundred dollars.\" (These were references to SpaceX launchers \u2014 the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket and its Starship Mars vehicle, which is in development.) \"Microgravity is just brutal on our bodies,\" Alatorre added \"We need artificial gravity \u2014 a mechanism to give us a dosage of gravity to give us the ability to live long-term in space.\"\u00a0 Related: Weightlessness and its effects on astronauts The planned gravity ring may also become a research platform for international space agencies and private aerospace firms interested in the effects of partial artificial gravity on both non-living and living systems, OAC representatives said. \"This will give researchers an unprecedented opportunity to access that intermediate gravity regime,\" Greenblatt said. \"This will then pave the way for OAC to build larger, more complex structures in space, which is obviously necessary if we're going to get to the point of building Voyager Station and other larger structures beyond.\" Looking into the future, government and private companies will be allowed to use the Voyager modules for lunar training missions and beyond, providing a launch pad for entrepreneurs to develop and market tourist activities in space. \"We don't want the Voyager experience to be like being in an attack submarine in combat, so we're [building] for comfort,\" said Tom Spilker, OAC's chief technology officer and vice president of engineering and space systems design. \"It's a bit smaller than the length of the U.S. Capitol building.\" \"Despite the seemingly endless list of luxury amenities, there will also be airlocks for visitors,\" Spilker added. \"So anyone who can afford a space hotel can go on a private spacewalk, where the only thing between you and the universe is a faceplate.\" Correction: A previous version of this story listed Gateway Foundation executive team member Tim Alatorre as the lead designer of the Voyager station project.

Instead of landing on the moon, the lunar module was used as a lifeboat as the crew struggled with freezing temperatures and limited capabilities to return to Earth. The sculpture's placement, in the same building that houses one of the last remaining Saturn V moon rockets, serves to honor both the Apollo 13 astronauts and the flight controllers in Mission Control at Johnson Space Center who worked around the clock for more than five days to ensure the crew's rescue.

Simply flatten Earth into two pancakes, one depicting the Northern Hemisphere and the other the Southern, with the equator running around the edge, a new study finds. These two \"pancakes\" represent the most accurate flat map of Earth ever made, the study researchers said. Unlike other flat maps, the new circular map doesn't downsize or supersize the area of certain oceans or landmasses \u2014 for instance, many 2D maps depict Greenland as about the same size as Africa, when in fact Africa is 14 times larger, Scientific American reported.\u00a0 Plus, unlike some retangular maps that are very large, \"this is a map you can hold in your hand,\" study lead researcher J. Richard Gott, an emeritus professor of astrophysics at Princeton University, said in a statement. \"The map can be printed front-and-back on a single magazine page, ready for the reader to cut out.\" Related: Photos: Christopher Columbus likely saw this 1491 map Creating accurate 2D maps has dogged cartographers for centuries. To help determine the various problems flat maps face, Gott and study co-researcher David Goldberg, a professor of physics at Drexel University in Philadelphia, created a system to rate existing flat maps, and published their results in 2007 in the journal Cartographica. Their system scored 2D maps on six types of distortions: local shapes, areas, distances, flexion (bending, or curvature distortions), skewness (lopsidedness) and boundary cuts (continuity gaps, like splitting up the Pacific Ocean). Maps that received lower scores were more accurate, they said. Well-designed globes, which are spherical like the Earth, would earn scores of zero. \"One can't make everything perfect\" on a flat Earth map, Gott said. \"A map that is good at one thing may not be good at depicting other things.\" Take, for example, the world map most people are familiar with \u2014 the Mercator projection, a staple found in many classrooms and the basis for Google Maps. While the Mercator projection is good at representing local shapes, it distorts surface areas near the North and South Poles, so these regions are often chopped off, the researchers said.  According to the team's rating system, the top-rated flat map projection is the Winkel Tripel, a map that originated in 1921, when German cartographer Oswald Winkel proposed it, and which the National Geographic Society now uses. This map drew a low score of 4.563, but it still had a \"boundary cut\" problem, because it split the Pacific Ocean in two, with one part on the right and the other on the left side of the map. This split creates the illusion that Asia and Hawaii are farther apart than they really are.  To get around this boundary-splitting problem, the researchers approached mapmaking from a new perspective, with the hopes of designing a \"flat map with the least error possible,\" Gott said. \"We're proposing a radically different kind of map, and we beat Winkel Tripel on each and every one of the six errors.\" The end result, the pancake map, borrowed ideas from previous research on polyhedra, or many-sided 3D shapes. In 1943, the American architect Richard Buckminster Fuller drew outlines of regular shapes that made up a world map, and he wrote instructions for how his map could be folded into a polyhedral globe. But while Fuller did a good job detailing the continents, he wasn't as exact with the oceans, which introduced errors. For instance, Australia and Antarctica were too far apart on his creation.  In a 2019 study posted to the arXiv database, which has yet to be peer reviewed, Gott considered \"envelope polyhedra,\" which involved gluing together regular shapes, back-to-back. This led to the idea of a double-sided circular map, he said. The new map, published Feb.15 to the arXiv database, consists of two pancake maps that can be viewed side-by-side or back-to-back. Either way, the map doesn't have any boundary cuts. If you want to measure distances from one hemisphere to the other, just use a string or a measuring tape to reach around the side of one pancake to the other, Gott said. \"If you're an ant, you can crawl from one side ... to the other,\" Gott said. \"We have continuity over the equator. [Africa] and South America are draped over the edge, like a sheet over a clothesline, but they're continuous.\" The pancake map also has smaller distance errors than any other 2D flat map. For instance, its configuration means distances can't be more or less than 22.2% of what they are in reality, Gott said. In comparison, the Mercator and Winkel Tripel projections have remarkably high distance errors near the poles and at the left and right edges of the map.\u00a0 \u201415 secretive places you can now see on Google Earth (and 3 you can't) \u201425 strangest sights on Google Earth \u2014Photos: Renaissance world map sports magical creatures What's more, areas at the pancake map's equatorial edge are only 1.57 times larger than areas at the center, the researchers said. Gott said he's not aware of any other double-sided pancake Earth. \"Our map is actually more like the globe than other flat maps,\" Gott said. \"To see all of the globe, you have to rotate it; to see all of our new map, you simply have to flip it over.\" Gott and his colleagues have also created pancake-like maps of Mars, Jupiter, the sun and other heavenly bodies, which can be seen here."}, {"source": "space.com", "title": "China's Tianwen-1 lowers its orbit around Mars to prepare for rover landing", "author": "Andrew Jones", "date": "25 February 2021", "fullarticle": "China's Tianwen-1 spacecraft has trimmed its orbit around Mars to allow the spacecraft to analyze the chosen landing region on the Red Planet.

These colorful sparks would almost certainly be too small and weak to pose a threat to Perseverance, or to any hypothetical humans who alight on\u00a0Mars\u00a0in the future, said lead study author Joshua M\u00e9ndez Harper, a geologist from the University of Oregon. However, the presence of electrostatic forces on Mars could have wide-ranging implications for how scientists understand the Red Planet's atmosphere and its potential to foster life, M\u00e9ndez Harper said. Related:\u00a0Here's the last thing NASA's Opportunity rover saw before 'lights out' \"Small sparks may catalyze the production of chemicals that may [impact] the presence of organic materials,\" M\u00e9ndez Harper told Live Science in an email. \"A recent paper suggested that perchlorates \u2014 compounds toxic to many forms of life \u2014 may be generated by small-scale discharges.\" The new study, set to be published in the March issue of the journal\u00a0Icarus, aims to decisively answer a question that has buzzed through the scientific community for half a century: Can colliding particles whipped up by high-speed winds in Mars' atmosphere spark electricity? This process is known as triboelectric charging \u2014 that is, electricity produced by the friction of colliding particles or surfaces. On\u00a0Earth, you can generate a small triboelectric spark, or\u00a0static electricity, in your bedroom by rubbing your socks on the carpet and then touching a metal doorknob (youch!). Or, for a grander demonstration, you can marvel at an\u00a0apocalyptic lightning storm\u00a0bolting through the ash column of an erupting volcano \u2014 the triboelectric result of ash particles colliding in the air.  On Mars, however, it's unclear whether triboelectric charging happens at all. Because Mars has much lower atmospheric pressure than Earth does, it's unlikely that powerful charges could build up there, M\u00e9ndez Harper said. Studies dating back to the 1970s have tried to simulate Martian dust storms on Earth by shaking up volcanic ash in small, low-pressure containers. Sometimes, those particles (which have similar compositions to Martian dust) do spark -- but according to the new Icarus paper, these studies may be fundamentally flawed. \"These works did not account for the possibility of charging arising from the interaction between simulated Martian dust and experimental containers enclosing it,\" M\u00e9ndez Harper said. \"The containers often had wildly different chemistries \u2014 plastic, metal or glass \u2014 that could have produced the observed electrical effects.\" In other words, in past studies, any observed sparks may have actually been between a dust particle and the side of the container enclosing it, rather than between two simulated Martian dust particles. These containers are made of stuff that doesn't exist on Mars, meaning the experiments don't really teach us anything about what happens within the Red Planet's dust storms. M\u00e9ndez Harper and his colleagues tried to correct this experimental design flaw in their new study.\u00a0 Similar to previous experiments, the team used volcanic ash grains (from Mexico's Xitle volcano, which erupted about 1,700 years ago) to simulate Martian dust particles, and enclosed them in a glass tube under conditions simulating the Martian atmosphere. Unlike prior experiments, however, the team used jets of\u00a0carbon dioxide\u00a0to stir the grains into a \"fountain\" of colliding particles that never touched the container wall. The team found that the colliding particles did result in small triboelectric sparks, even when those dust grains did not come into contact with the container. For the researchers, then, this study provides the first reliable experimental evidence of triboelectric charging on Mars. What would those charges look like? It's hard to say. Although the researchers detected shocks in their Martian dust fountain electronically, they observed no visual effects resulting from the collisions. Given the low atmospheric pressure on Mars, it's unlikely that even the fiercest dust storms would ripple with lightning the way terrestrial volcanoes or thunderclouds do. \"A more likely possibility is that Martian dust storms display innumerable small sparks \u2014 called streamer discharges and glow discharges,\" M\u00e9ndez Harper said.

However, scientists weren't sure if the variant was indeed more contagious than previous strains or if it became more common simply by chance \u2014 for instance, through a few superspreading events.\nIn a new study, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, researchers analyzed 2,172 virus samples collected in California between September 2020 and January 2021. They found that although the variant hadn't yet shown up in September, by January, it had become the predominant variant in California, with cases doubling every 18 days, The New York Times reported.\nWhat's more, lab studies found that the variant was 40% better at infecting human cells compared with earlier strains, according to The New York Times. In addition, people who tested positive for the California variant had twice the viral load (or levels of the virus) in the nose and throat than people infected with other versions of the virus. This may mean that people infected with the California variant can spread it more easily than people infected with other strains, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nThe researchers said their findings mean that B.1.427/B.1.429 should be considered a \"variant of concern\" similar to the variants that emerged in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil.\u00a0\n\"The devil is already here,\" study lead author Dr. Charles Chiu, a virologist at the University of California, San Francisco, told the LA Times. \"I wish it were different. But the science is the science.\"\nLab experiments also found that antibodies in people who had been infected with other strains of the novel coronavirus or who had been vaccinated against COVID-19 were less effective at \"neutralizing\" or disabling the California variant.\nStill, the California variant may not be as successful as the South African variant in evading current vaccines. In lab studies, the South African variant elicited \u00a0sixfold lower levels of antibodies than the levels produced in response to other strains, Live Science previously reported. But the levels of antibodies produced in response to the California variant were just twofold lower, the LA Times reported.\nThere is also very early evidence that the California variant may be deadlier than other strains. When Chiu and colleagues analyzed about 300 cases of B.1.427/B.1.429 in San Francisco, they found that those infected with this variant were much more likely to die than those infected with other coronavirus strains.

Authorities have yet to identify the culprit, but they say it is harmful to both humans and marine life.\nIsrael's Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) called the spill \"one of the most serious ecological disasters\" the country has ever seen and warned it could take years to completely remove the waste from beaches, according to the BBC.\nThe tar was first noticed on Israel's beaches on Wednesday (Feb. 18) after a heavy winter storm battered the coastline. Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry estimates that as much as 1,100 tons (1,000 metric tons) of tar have already washed ashore, according to Aljazeera.\nRelated: The 10 weirdest spills in nature\nNormally, oil spills form a thin slick across the water surface, with some washing up on beaches in a more liquid form. The Israel spill, however, turned into tar balls because rough sea conditions \u00a0brokeup the slick and mixed it into the seawater for several days creating small concentrated blobs of congealed oil (tar balls), according to NOAA.\u00a0\nOn Saturday (Feb. 21), satellite images from the European Maritime Safety Agency showed that the spill had most likely originated about 31 miles (50 kilometers) off Israel's coast, but the exact cause of the spill and what is responsible for it are still unknown, according to Haaretz.\nThousands of volunteers turned out at beaches across Israel's coastline once the storm subsided to remove the tar by hand, after environmental NGOs including Ecoocean and Zalul requested the public\u2019s help. Soldiers from the Israeli army were also sent to help deal with the cleanup effort.\n\nHowever, several volunteers had to be taken to hospital after breathing in toxic fumes given off by the sludge. On Sunday (Feb. 22), government officials closed the entire length of Israel's 120-mile (195 km) Mediterranean coastline to members of the public, due to health concerns.\nAlthough it is still too early to know the exact impacts of this spill on the marine environment, officials fear that it could be extremely damaging, according to Aljazeera.\nOn Wednesday (Feb. 18), a 55-foot-long (17 meters) fin whale washed up dead on a beach in southern Israel at the same time as the first globules of tar were washing up to the north. A necropsy (animal autopsy) by INPA veterinarians revealed the whale's stomach was filled with a black liquid; further testing that's being undertaken will confirm whether that liquid is oil.\n\nSeveral distressing photos have also circulated online showing juvenile turtles covered in black sludge that have washed up across the coastline. Some were taken to the Israeli Sea Turtle Rescue Center, but many were already dead when they washed up, Haaretz reported.\nWhales, turtles and seabirds are some of the most at risk marine animals from oil spills because they breathe and feed at the surface.\n\"Imagine that you tar a roof to seal it. Imagine a whole world of living things being sealed off and suffocated by tar,\" said Ruth Yahel, a marine ecologist with INPA, talking to the Times of Israel.\nAnd experts worry that the tar that has washed ashore is only a fraction of the toxic sludge still out there.\n\"The greatest fear is that there is a lot more tar in the sea right now that is poisoning wildlife, and still hasn't reached us,\" said Dor Adelist, a marine scientist from the University of Haifa, talking to the news outlet Walla, as reported by the Times of Israel.\nEnvironmental groups, including INPA, have criticized the government in the wake of the oil spill after multiple failed attempts to establish programs and funding to deal with oil spills in the last two decades, according to the Times of Israel. As a result, there were no real plans in place to effectively deal with the sticky situation when it began.\nThere is also some controversy about the origins of the spill.\nThe Environmental Protection Ministry (EPM) was investigating a number of ships believed to have been in the vicinity of the spill and therefore potentially responsible for the mess. \"We are making every effort to find those responsible for the disaster, and we will bring to the government's approval tomorrow a proposal for resolutions to rehabilitate the environment,\" said EPM minister Gila Gamliel in a tweet, according to Aljazeera.\nHowever, on Monday morning (Feb. 22), a judge had issued a gag order on details pertaining to the oil spill. This prevents the Israeli press from publishing anything about the identity of any suspects or vessels involved, including their cargo, destination and port, for a week. The Israeli news outlet Haaretz called the gag order an \"unusual move\" that could suggest some sort of cover-up.\n\u2014 7 surprising uses of oil\n\u2014 Sea science: 7 bizarre facts about the ocean\n\u2014 In photos: Litter transforms into sea creatures in stunning shots\nThe spill also coincides with the recent signing of an agreement to build a new oil pipeline between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel, which was announced in October 2020.

They found springhares' striking fluorescent colors to be \"funky and vivid,\" forming patterns that were highly diverse \"relative to biofluorescence found in other mammals,\" they wrote in a new study.\u00a0\nRelated: Bioluminescent: A glow-in-the-dark gallery\nBiofluorescent animals have fur or skin that absorbs and reemits short-wavelength light as a longer wavelength, changing its color. Many types of invertebrates, reptiles, amphibians, fish and birds are fluorescent, but in recent years, scientists have also discovered fluorescence in mammals that are active at dusk or nighttime, such as flying squirrels, opossums and platypuses.\nSpringhares, the sole members of the rodent genus Pedetidae, are also nocturnal. There are two species \u2014 P. capensis and P. surdaster \u2014 found respectively in southern Africa, and in parts of Kenya and Tanzania. They have short forelimbs and powerful, kangaroolike hind limbs for hopping. And both species glow, according to the study.\u00a0\nResearchers exposed springhares' hidden shine while searching for signs of biofluorescence in flying squirrels and other gliding mammals in the collection of the Field Museum in Chicago, said lead study author Erik R. Olson, an associate professor of natural resources at Northland College in Ashland, Wisconsin. Their quest led them to scaly-tailed squirrels, which didn't glow, and then to a nearby drawer holding the squirrels' closest living relatives: springhares.\n\"We saw this pinkish-orange biofluorescence in the drawers, and that was an exciting moment,\" Olson told Live Science in an email. \"Seeing something like this, probably for the first time \u2014 it really stoked the fires of curiosity.\"\n\nIn all, they examined 14 museum specimens and six captive-bred springhares \u2014 five living and one deceased. Under UV light, dark brown fur on the springhares' backs lit up in streaks, spots and patches of vivid pink.\u00a0\n\"Both male and female specimens fluoresced in the same regions and with the same intensity,\" the study authors reported.\u00a0\nSpringhares' glowing colors are produced by organic compounds called porphyrins, according to the study. Springhares likely get their pink glow from coproporphyrin and uroporphyrin, which the scientists isolated from the animals' fur, said study co-author Michaela Carlson, an assistant professor of chemistry at Northland College. These two compounds fluoresce in the yellow, orange or red regions of the visible spectrum \"depending on the conditions,\" Carlson told Live Science in an email.\u00a0\nAnd unlike other glowing mammals, the springhares' bright patterns were highly variable between individuals, and even downright patchy in some.\u00a0\n\n\u2013 10 amazing things you didn't know about animals\n\u2013 Amazing photos of nocturnal animals\n\u2013 Extreme life on Earth: 8 bizarre creatures\n\"The most intensely fluorescent regions were generally around the hindquarters,\" Carlson said. At first, the scientists wondered if the springhares applied color-changing porphyrins to their fur through grooming, \"since porphyrins can be excreted via urine and feces,\" Carlson said in the email. The researchers ultimately ruled out that hypothesis, since they couldn't wash porphyrins off the springhares' fur. Visible light degrades these chemicals, \"so potentially some of the patterning is due to this exposure,\" Carlson explained.\nAnother possibility is that the patterning may serve as a type of camouflage, creating visual \"noise\" that could protect springhares from predators that are UV-sensitive, Olson said.\u00a0\n\"However, there is also a good chance this trait doesn't play any role in intra- or inter- species interactions,\" he added. \"Further research is required.\"\u00a0\nMost \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the known mammals that demonstrate biofluorescence are most active in low-light environments, which suggests that biofluorescence could be a more widespread feature among species that are out and about during dusk or at night. \"But a thorough evaluation of a wider suite of species is still required to determine whether it is in fact more common in this group or not,\" Olson said.\u00a0\nThe findings were published online Feb. 18 in the journal Scientific Reports."}, {"source": "livescience.com", "title": "Extremists struggle with certain kinds of brain processing, research shows", "author": "Stephanie Pappas", "date": "23 February 2021", "fullarticle": "Scientists have found the psychological signature of people who are likely to hold dogmatic or extremist views.\u00a0\nIt makes sense, the researchers said, as people who are dogmatic tend to be impulsive but also slow to process perceptual information. Extremists \u2014 regardless of whether they are right-wing or left-wing \u2014 also tend to struggle with complex cognitive tasks, but they have a high tolerance for risk, according to the new study, published Sunday (Feb. 21) in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.\u00a0\n\"They tend to seek out sensations and thrills and risks,\" study lead author Leor Zmigrod, a psychologist at the University of Cambridge, told Live Science. \"And that's really congruent with what we can imagine about the individual who is willing to go and fight and commit violence for their cause.\"\u00a0\nRelated: Fight, fight, fight: The history of human aggression\nThe study isn't the first to try to connect political ideology to more basic psychology, but simple narratives are hard to come by. About a decade ago, multiple studies began to reveal that conservatives were more sensitive to disgust than liberals, but more recent work has failed to find similar results. Similarly, research suggesting that conservatives are more worried about threats than liberals may have defined both threats and ideology too narrowly: In a recent study published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, researchers looked at people from around the world, and using a broad definition of threats, they found no evidence that conservatives are actually more cowardly.\nFor many of these studies, scientists relied on self-reporting and tried to link a single ideology to a single cognitive or emotional trait, Zmigrod said. She and her colleagues took a broader view: They didn't hypothesize about what cognitive or personality traits might be linked to which ideological views. Instead, they put 522 people through 37 cognitive tasks and 22 personality surveys. The cognitive tasks were very basic. For example, a participant would view a screen full of moving dots and would have to quickly answer whether most of the dots were moving left or right.\u00a0\nFrom the answers, Zmigrod said, \"you can start to infer how they are processing information from the environment.\"\u00a0\nIn the second phase of the study, the participants were invited to respond again to a set of surveys about their political beliefs and the strengths of those beliefs; 334 of the original participants agreed to respond.\u00a0\nWith this wealth of responses, the researchers were able to find correlations between particular cognitive and personality traits and ideology. Zmigrod's previous work has found that extremism and dogmatism on either side of the political spectrum are linked to a lack of cognitive flexibility, which is the ability to think about concepts simultaneously or switch between ways of thinking. (Cognitive flexibility is often tested by giving people a task and then changing the rules of that task partway through. More flexible people will adapt more quickly to the new rules.)\u00a0\nThe new study also suggested that dogmatism and extremism are linked to slower, more strenuous processing. People who are dogmatic may process information imperfectly and then act impulsively on that information, the researchers found. Extremists \u2014 defined as people supportive of violence to protect their ideological in-group \u2014 were thrill seekers in personality but were slow in working memory, or the ability to keep information in mind while conducting a task. They also used fewer perceptual strategies to solve problems.\u00a0\n\"They tend to perform more poorly on these complex high-level processing tasks,\" Zmigrod said.\u00a0\nThe researchers also found that people with nationalistic and politically conservative ideologies showed more caution in perceptual decision making, reducing their speed, rather than their accuracy, when challenged to a time-sensitive task.\u00a0\n\"That's really fascinating because caution really is almost a synonym for conservatism,\" Zmigrod said.\u00a0\n\u2014 Why did the Democratic and Republican parties switch platforms?\n\u2014 Life's extremes: Conservatives vs. liberals\n\u2014 Conservatives more likely to know 'the meaning of life' than liberals\nThese psychological traits explained far more of the variation between people than demographic information alone. Demographics, for example, explained 7.43% of the difference between people in political conservatism, while demographics plus psychological traits explained 32.5%. Demographics alone explained only 1.53% of the variation in dogmatism between people, while a combination of demographics and psychological traits explained 23.6%, or 15 times more.\u00a0\nThe research raises the question of whether strategies to improve people's cognitive flexibility or information processing might make them more resistant to developing extremist views, Zmigrod said. The researchers are also planning to study how these psychological traits are linked to genetics and brain functioning; those findings, in turn, could help tie together how people's experiences interact with their psychology.\u00a0\n\"We're trying to see how environments might interact with personal vulnerability to make a person extreme or dogmatic,\" Zmigrod said."}, {"source": "livescience.com", "title": "Woman contracts COVID-19 from lung transplant in a first", "author": "Rachael Rettner", "date": "23 February 2021", "fullarticle": "A lifesaving operation turned tragic when a Michigan woman contracted COVID-19 from her double lung transplant last year and died soon after.\nThe case marks the first time that doctors have confirmed COVID-19 transmission through an organ transplant, according to a report of the case, published Feb. 10 in the American Journal of Transplantation.\nA surgeon involved in the woman's case also contracted COVID-19, likely during the transplant procedure, the report said.

To refloat relatively small whales like long-finned pilots (Globicephala melas), which are members of the dolphin family, people typically use waterproof tarps to gently move the animals into open water and allow them time to reorient before swimming away, according to Particle, an Australian science publication.\u00a0\nIn general, the whales can grow to be about 19 to 25 feet (5.7-7.6 meters) long and weigh between 2,900 and 5,000 pounds (1,315-2,267 kilograms) each, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).They are not considered endangered, but scientists do not have enough data to precisely determine the long-finned pilot whale\u2019s conservation status, according to Oceana.\nThe volunteers didn't note if they used tarps in this rescue, but because the whales on Farewell Spit were spread out along the beach, the crew first herded the animals back into a pod, the AP reported. Roughly 200 people then formed a barrier at the shoreline and guided the pod into deeper water; once the whales got deep enough, boats began patrolling the shore to block the whales from returning.\n\u2014Deep blue sea: Winning underwater photographs\n\u2014Sea science: 7 bizarre facts about the ocean\n\u201415 of the largest animals of their kind on Earth\nBut in the end, the whales didn't swim away into the ocean, so there's still fear that they may strand again, Hawkes told the AP. \"Everyone is very hopeful but also very realistic,\" she said.\nIn New Zealand, long-finned pilot whales account for the majority of mass strandings, where two or more whales strand at one time, according to New Zealand's Department of Conservation. Sometimes, hundreds of whales can beach themselves at one time. Four years ago, for example, two mass strandings left 350 long-finned pilot whales dead on Farewell Spit, while whale rescue groups managed to refloat about 300 others, according to the AP.\nScientists still aren't sure why mass strandings occur. But whales' echolocation may not work well near the shoreline, so they might become disoriented and unable to find their way back to open water, Live Science previously reported. It's also possible that, once one whale strands, others in the pod follow close behind to help and end up beaching themselves. \u00a0"}, {"source": "livescience.com", "title": "Rare Roman-era phallus carving found in UK", "author": "Laura Geggel", "date": "23 February 2021", "fullarticle": "Archaeologists in the United Kingdom have unearthed a stone carving of a giant phallus, which might have served a good luck charm at the time it was chiseled 2,000 years ago.\u00a0\nThe Roman-era millstone \u2014 a stone used for grinding grains, such as wheat \u2014 was broken when an excavation team initially discovered it and other millstones during fieldwork in 2017 and 2018, ahead of a construction project on the A14 road, according to Oxford Archaeology, a private archaeological company in the U.K. Only recently, once archaeologists studied the broken millstone, did they realize it sported phallic imagery.\n\"As one of only four known examples of Romano-British millstones decorated this way, the A14 millstone is a highly significant find,\" Ruth Shaffrey, a worked-stone specialist at Oxford Archaeology South, said in a statement. \"It offers insights into the importance of the mill to the local community and to the protective properties bestowed upon the millstone and its produce (the flour) by the depiction of a phallus on its upper surface.\"\nRelated: Image gallery: The little horny man\nArchaeologists found more than 300 millstones and querns, or hand-size grain grinders, during the excavation.

Worn with the hair cut short in front and long at the back of the head, mullets surged in popularity during the 1980s. Archaeologists recently discovered the same hairstyle on a copper figure measuring about 2 inches (5 centimeters) high, found in an Iron Age site in Cambridgeshire, England, and dating to the first century A.D. Like countless soccer players, hockey stars, rock musicians and mallgoers that came thousands of years later, the statue's hair is cropped close to its head around the crown and flows long down its back, representatives of the National Trust in the United Kingdom said in a statement.

Perseverance aims to change that, with a plan to drill and capture up to 30 test-tube-size samples from the mudstone rocks in its landing site, known as Jezero crater.\u00a0 A key challenge will be ensuring that these samples are the best ones possible, giving scientists the most informational bang for their buck. To find out more about how NASA's engineers will do that, Live Science reached out to geochemist and Perseverance project scientist Ken Farley of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. Related:\u00a0Photo tour of Jezero Crater: Here's where Perseverance will land on Mars Images from orbiting spacecraft have already identified the 28-mile-wide (45 kilometers) Jezero crater as an ancient water-carved delta, where a river flowed into an ancient lake. Perseverance is scheduled to land in the delta's basin, most likely near the base of some cliffs full of fine-grained sedimentary rocks, Farley said.\u00a0 After touchdown, mission controllers will probably tell the rover to drive to the cliff base, he added, since such sediments were liable to have been laid down by mud collected by the river water that flowed out into the ancient floodplains of the delta. That's where Perseverance will hunt for indicators of past life. \"If you want to find some structure made by a living organism, you don't want to do it in a raging river,\" Farley said. \"It gets destroyed.\"  Book of Mars: $22.99 at Magazines Direct Within 148 pages, explore the mysteries of Mars.

Find out about its landscape and formation, discover the truth about water on Mars and the search for life, and explore the possibility that the fourth rock from the sun may one day be our next home.View Deal Mud is an excellent preserver of biosignatures, or chemical clues left behind by living creatures, because it can trap and hold onto materials as it gets laid down. Orbital images have also indicated volcanic rocks lurking in the same area, so it's possible the rover will try to collect at least a couple samples at the cliff base, Farley said.\u00a0 From orbit, researchers can't tell if the volcanic rock is above or below the mudstones, meaning they don't know which one is older, and was therefore laid down first. Perseverance will be able to visually identify this key fact using its cameras and then, once the samples have returned to Earth, chemists will be able to use the decay rates of radioactive elements to figure out the rocks' exact ages, said Farley. In some sense, Perseverance has a leg up on its nearly identical cousin, Curiosity, a rover that landed on Mars in 2012 and has been exploring a region called Gale crater ever since, he added. Curiosity has spent years determining whether or not Gale was an ancient lake, meaning it could have been a good abode for life. The evidence that Jezero had a watery past is much clearer. \"Our mudstone is in a delta,\" said Farley.\u00a0 Mission controllers will also look for samples with carbonate minerals \u2014 rocks that contain carbon compounds such as limestone. Carbonates on Earth preserve a great deal of information about past climatic conditions, Farley said, and the same is hoped for such rocks on Mars.\u00a0 With these samples in hand, terrestrial researchers could determine the pH, or level of acidity, of the ancient lake water, as well as its salinity. The most important question that could be answered in Farley's mind is how long the lake lasted at Jezero. \"Was that lake there for 100 years? 1,000 years? A million? 10 million?\" he said, adding that each of these different time frames would have different implications for how long organisms could have lived in the area.\u00a0 Experiments to glean such data can't really be done on Mars because they require large instruments or a great deal of manual processing that requires human technicians. But some analyses will be easier to do on the Red Planet with Perseverance and its suite of state-of-the-art instruments, said Farley.\u00a0 As an example, he mentioned the rover's Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals (SHERLOC) and Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) instruments. These should be able to detect and map organic material in rocks on the ground, meaning that scientists will already be making key breakthroughs long before samples come back to Earth.\u00a0 That's good because Perseverance will have to wait years before a second mission can bring its rock collection home. During that time, Perseverance will need to gather what researchers believe to be the most important samples. NASA has appointed a special group of Return Sample Scientists who will help determine exactly which rocks the rover will take samples from. \u201410 Interesting places in the solar system we'd like to visit \u2014Voyager to Mars rover: NASA's 10 greatest innovations \u2014Space oddity: 10 bizarre things Earthlings launched into space Perseverance will store its treasures in a small canister and either drive them over to this future, as-yet-unbuilt robot or set them down somewhere to be picked up, allowing them to be placed in a small rocket and brought to Martian orbit. The current plan is for such a mission to be built by and launched in 2026, and so Farley's team is expecting to have all their samples stored by 2028, when that spacecraft would land on Mars.\u00a0 \"After that, it's pencils down,\" he said. It's possible that, due to budget and time constraints, the sample collection mission will be delayed by around two years. But in either case, \"there's a fascinating tension between wanting to get the best stuff, needing to get everything and getting to the party on time,\" said Farley. For that reason, the team is hoping to be \"disciplined and flexible,\" he added, since they don't yet know exactly how much room there will be on the return rocket. It's possible that, in the end, engineers will be able to build a rocket that can only carry enough fuel to bring 20 samples, Farley said.

While digging in a wooded region known as \"Hell Hole Swamp\" (part of South Carolina's Francis Marion National Forest) outside Charlottesville, the researchers discovered a metal barrel, a green garden hose, cinder blocks and various pieces of scrap metal, according to South Carolina's Post and Courier. Despite their motley appearance, these artifacts are likely remnants of an illegal liquor-distilling operation run by a notorious local bootlegger and Capone associate named Benjamin Villeponteaux, said Katherine Parker, a graduate student at the University of Tennessee Knoxville who led the expedition into Hell Hole Swamp, as reported by the Post and Courier. \"As archaeological sites, defunct or busted liquor stills are often mistaken for modern trash dumps,\" Parker wrote on her website. \"However, there are several key signatures that can be used to distinguish them.\"  The cinder blocks are one of those signatures. Parker called in an architectural historian to analyze the blocks' size and materials, and found they dated to the 1920s.

A separate apparatus, connected by a hose, would have drawn out the alcohol vapors and condensed them into a liquid again.

The statement follows a news conference held by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week, during which scientists listed frozen packages of food as a possible source of coronavirus transmission, NPR reported. The link or lack thereof between food and coronavirus spread also has implications for figuring out the origin of the coronavirus outbreak and later pandemic, which seems to have started in Wuhan, China. Disease ecologist Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team investigating the origins of the pandemic, said that the team is \"trying to keep an open mind\" about what sparked the early COVID-19 superspreader event at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan. In recent months, Chinese state media has pushed a theory that the coronavirus first emerged elsewhere and that it hitched a ride on frozen food sold at the market, Reuters reported. And China has also blamed frozen food imports for a spate of new infections, saying several packages have tested positive for the virus, The Wall Street Journal reported. The seafood market outbreak was most likely tied to a live animal at the market, or an infected vendor or customer, but the WHO team hasn't discounted frozen meat and seafood as another potential source of infection, Daszak said, according to NPR.

She also noted that there's an \"international consensus\" about the low risk of transmission from food and food packaging, and that no national or international surveillance systems have found a link between food products and COVID-19 transmission. \"Considering the more than 100 million cases of COVID-19, we have not seen epidemiological evidence of food or food packaging as the source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans,\" she wrote. Chinese scientists did link frozen food to a COVID-19 outbreak at the Xinfadi Market in Beijing last summer, after finding the coronavirus on a frozen codfish and inside its packaging, NPR reported. However, finding the virus on food and packaging doesn't provide direct evidence that humans can pick up enough virus from a contaminated product to actually contract COVID-19, Woodcock wrote.\u00a0 In addition, the coronavirus cases linked to the Xinfadi Market occurred in warehouse workers and dockworkers who had handled enormous, international shipments of frozen meat and seafood, NPR reported. \"China hasn't had any reports of consumers, of even suspicion, of consumers being infected by this route,\" microbiologist Emanuel Goldman of the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School told NPR. \u201411 (sometimes) deadly diseases that hopped across species \u201414 coronavirus myths busted by science \u2014The 12 deadliest viruses on Earth\u00a0 In the warehouse-size Xinfadi Market, frozen food arrives in massive pallets, which likely remain cold for longer than a single package of fish would at the grocery store, Goldman said. The persistent cold could theoretically help preserve the virus and somewhat raise the risk of transmission for warehouse workers, he said. But even under these circumstances, the risk of transmission from frozen food would still be miniscule, Goldman said. \"It's so rare as to be of negligible importance in the real world to most people,\" he said. To become infected, a person would need to inhale a large number of live coronavirus particles; but the number of particles that would likely be picked up from contaminated food or packages would be very small, according to the FDA statement. In any case, basic personal hygiene and food safety measures can cut any risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from food or packages, Live Science previously reported.

A private pterosaur collector in London bought the fossil slab from a seller in Morocco and originally mistook the fossilized fish lung as part of a pterodactyl skull. But on closer inspection, he was unsure, so he contacted Martill to get his professional opinion.\u00a0  \"He sent me a bunch of pictures, and I really didn't know what it was,\" Martill told Live Science. \"But I really didn't think it was part of the pterosaur.\"\u00a0 However, after visiting the fossil slab in person, Martill knew exactly what he was looking at. \"I realized that instead of being one bone, it was actually hundreds of very thin sheets of bone,\" Martill said. The fossil lung was somewhat barrel-shaped, but instead of the staves \u2014 the wooden planks that make up a barrel \u2014 lined up along the barrel, they were wrapped around it and overlapping. \"There's only one species that has a bone structure like that, and that's the coelacanth fish,\" Martill said. \"They actually wrap their lung in this bony sheath, it's a very unusual structure.\" Initially disappointed, the collector allowed Martill to separate the lung from the rest of the slab so it could be properly analyzed. After discovering the fossilized lung, Martill teamed up with Brazlillian paleontologist Paulo Brito, a world leading expert in coelacanth lungs, from the State University of Rio de Janeiro. Brito confirmed Martill's suspicions and was \"astonished\" at the size of the specimen, according to a statement from the University of Portsmouth.\u00a0  Previously discovered ancient coelacanths lived in rivers and had bodies extending between 10 and 13 feet (3 and 4 meters) in length; but the new unnamed species, which is thought to have lived in the open ocean, would have been much bigger. Modern-day coelacanths are smaller than both and reach around 6 feet (1.8 m) long. \"The coelacanth body plan has been pretty constant for the last few hundred million years,\" Martill said. \"This one is just much bigger.\" The collector has since donated the lung to the Department of Geology at Hassan II University of Casablanca in Morocco. One of the biggest mysteries surrounding the fossilized lung is where the rest of the coelacanth's massive body ended up. Martill's leading theory is that one of the large reptilian marine predators that dominated the Cretaceous oceans \u2014 such as plesiosaurs and mosasaurs \u2014 may have eaten it \"Coelacanths were slow-swimming fishes; this massive version would have been easy prey for these big predators,\" Martill said.\u00a0 The researchers also found damage on the lung, which also suggests the fish was bitten by one of these massive predators.\u00a0  Plesiosaurs and mosasaurs would have also regurgitated up large bones from their meals, like modern-day lizards do, which could explain why the lung ended up isolated with other bones from different animals. It would also explain why other coelacanths haven't been found in the area, as the fish may have been eaten hundreds of miles away and then regurgitated much later. However, there is no way to prove that it died in this way. \"We haven't written about this in the paper, because the evidence is really tenuous,\" Martill said. \"It's a good story but it's only one possibility.\" What happened to the rest of the coelacanths is also a mystery. They completely disappear from the fossil record at the end of the Cretaceous period, which is what originally led scientists to think they were extinct. But live coelacanths found within the last century prove that at least one species managed to survive.\u00a0 \u00a0\u2014 In photos: Sea life thrives at otherworldly hydrothermal vent system \u2014 Ocean sounds: The 8 weirdest noises of the Antarctic \u2014 Sea science: 7 bizarre facts about the ocean \"We keep finding coelacanths up until the end of the Cretaceous, and then they just disappear,\" Martill said. \"This is one of the last coelacanths before what we call the pseudoextinction.\" It is possible that these giant coelacanths could still secretly roam the unexplored pockets of the deep sea today. But although he hopes this might be the case, Martill admitted: \"the evidence of this happening isn't good.\" The study was published online Feb. 15 in the journal Cretaceous Research."}, {"source": "livescience.com", "title": "Critically endangered baby whale washes up dead on Florida coast", "author": "Patrick Pester", "date": "19 February 2021", "fullarticle": "A critically endangered North Atlantic right whale calf washed up dead on a beach in Florida on Feb. 13, in the latest blow to the dwindling species.\u00a0 The male calf was 22 feet (7 meters) long and possibly just 2 months old when it was found with boat wounds on the shore at Anastasia State Park near St. Augustine, according to The Associated Press.\u00a0 This is the second recorded death of a right whale calf during the current calving season, which runs from mid-November to mid-April.

Called body awareness, this ability is one of the most basic manifestations of self-representation (also known as self-awareness). Humans develop body awareness very early in life: 5-month-old babies can distinguish their own moving legs from a video recording of the same action, for example. This ability then develops into more complex forms of distinguishing oneself from those around them. Previous research mainly tested species on more complex forms of the ability. For example, one of the most famous tests of self-representation is the \"mirror-mark task,\" in which animals are thought to possess a more advanced form of self-representation, if they can recognize themselves in a mirror.\u00a0 Related: 7 ways animals are like humans  Perfect Pets: $11.99 at Magazines Direct \"Perfect Pets\" is the ultimate guide to the world\u2019s most popular animal companions.

But dogs had not. Scientists lost interest in studying species that didn't show these complex forms of self-representation, Pongr\u00e1cz said. But in the new study, he and his team decided to take a \"bottom-up approach\" and investigate whether dogs show a lower level of self-representation \u2014 one that would be ecologically relevant to them.\u00a0 \"Dogs are intelligent, large-bodied, fast-moving creatures that move in a complex environment,\" Pongr\u00e1cz told Live Science. \"Therefore, body awareness would be theoretically important for them when negotiating various obstacles, for example.\" To test canine body awareness, the researchers recruited 32 dogs and conducted a \"body as an obstacle\" task. This test had previously been conducted only on elephants and toddlers.  The dogs had to pick up and give an object to their owner while standing on a small mat; however, the object was attached to the mat such that the dog had to get off the mat in order to lift the object (and the mat). In other words, their bodies served as an obstacle to the task at hand, and the dogs needed to deliberately move that obstacle to complete the task. The researchers accounted for other factors, such as fear-inducing conditions, that might otherwise lead the dog to get off the mat or give up on the task, Pongr\u00e1cz said. \u2014 10 amazing things you didn't know about animals \u2014 20 weird dog and cat behaviors explained by science \u2014 4 ways owning a dog can make you healthier \"When dogs pulled on the toy, it also started to lift the mat \u2014 thus the dog felt that the mat was jerking under its paws as it was pulling the toy,\" Pongr\u00e1cz said. \"In this scenario, the dogs quickly left the mat, usually still holding the toy in their mouth; then they gave it to the owner.\" The researchers found that the dogs came off the mat more frequently and more quickly when the object was attached to the mat than when the object was attached to the ground, which the researchers used for comparison purposes. This is \"the first evidence that dogs may be capable of understanding the connection between their own body and the environment through the feedback effect of their own actions,\" Pongr\u00e1cz said. Dogs have also shown other basic components of self-representation, including the ability to recognize their own odor, body-size awareness and episodic memory,or personal memories of specific events, according to the study.

In fact, it's fair to say that the FX3 is effectively a redesigned A7S III, with the two cameras sharing a lot of the same specs. Both are 12.1MP full-frame cameras that are compatible with Sony's E-Mount lenses and can shoot 4K/60p video. But the FX3 sits in Sony's Cinema line, which means it's specifically designed for pro filmmakers, rather than the hybrid shooters targeted by the Alpha-badged A7S III. According to Sony, the latter is targeted more at those who need to shoot a mix of high-quality stills and video, like wedding and concert photographers.  So how to the two cameras differ? The main physical differences are that the FX3 lacks the built-in electronic viewfinder (EVF) seen on the A7S III, but gains some fan-assisted active cooling (for longer continuous shooting) and a bundled handle accessory.\u00a0 This handle (below) lets you smooth shots from low angles and also cleverly boosts the FX3's audio options.\u00a0This is because the handle slots into its multi-interface shoe and includes twin XLR/TRS jacks. These are the go-to standard for pro audio recording and gives it the same sound options as the Sony FX6, a much larger camera that costs a somewhat more painful $6,000 / \u00a36,000 / AU$9,500. It's possible to add these XLR terminals to a camera like the Sony A7S III using an adapter kit, but this is a more clunky solution than the FX3's handle. The fact that this XLR handle is included with the FX3 also explains why it's slightly pricier than the Sony A7S III.  The FX3 also gains some other filmmaking-specific extras, including a rather fetching tally lamp (below), which clearly shows when the camera is recording to avoid any mishaps.\u00a0 Also on the back of the FX3 is a 3-inch, 1.44m-dot touchscreen, which flips out to the side for those who are looking to film themselves. And just like the A7S III, on the side you also get twin CFexpress / SD card slots and a full-size HDMI port, which can output 16-bit raw video (although Sony hasn't yet said which external recorders are going to be supported).  Thanks to the inclusion of the same back-illuminated 12.1MP full-frame sensor as the A7S III, which promises 15 stops of dynamic range, the FX3 promises to shoot similarly excellent video quality, particularly in low-light situations.\u00a0 There's an option to shoot slo-mo 4K/120p footage, and the FX3 also has the popular S-Cinetone color profile, which recently arrived on the A7S III via a firmware update. Because it's designed for solo, run-and-gun filmmaking, the FX3 also has in-body image stabilization (IBIS) along with an electronic Active Mode, which gives you even stronger stabilization at the expense of a 10% crop.\u00a0 We haven't found Sony's stabilization to be the best, though, so FX3 shooters may still need to consider using a gimbal or Sony's Catalyst software in the edit room.    For a camera that weighs only 715g with a card and battery (just 16g more than the A7S III) the Sony FX3 certainly packs in some powerful shooting features. It can shoot 4K video with 10-bit 4:2:2 color sampling internally, and can also output 16-bit raw video to an external recorder via its full-size HDMI port. Surely the combination of this shooting power and the FX3's size is a recipe for over-heating? Well, thanks to one other difference from the Sony A7S III \u2013\u00a0an active cooling system with built-in fans \u2013\u00a0Sony is promising 'uninterrupted' 4K/60p shooting, with a maximum continuous recording time of 13 hours. The FX3 might not be able to shoot 8K video, but that's pretty impressive for such a small camera and it trumps the A7S III in this regard.  12.1MP BSI full-frame sensor\nBionz XR processor\nShoot 4K/120p or FHD/240p video\nRecord in 10-bit 4:2:2 internally\nExpanded ISO range of 80-409,600\n15-stop dynamic range\nHave S-Cinetone, S-Log3/2 profiles\n5-axis image stabilization\nSame Hybrid AF autofocus system\n16-bit raw video via HDMI port\nTwin CFexpress Type A / SD slots\nSame NP-FZ100 battery\nDust and moisture-resistant\nSame touchscreen menu system Slightly less impressive is the absence of built-in ND filters, which are a pretty useful for filmmakers, particularly when shooting in bright conditions.\u00a0 Sony says this is because they wanted to make the FX3 as compact as possible, but it's an omission that could make it less appealing to some filmmakers. Still, despite that lack of built-in ND filters, there's no doubt that the Sony FX3 has a highly impressive feature set for such a compact camera. It's not the first small cinema camera we've seen that shoehorns in the power of a much larger body. The Canon EOS C70 recently pulled off a similar trick, packing in most of the Canon C300 Mark II's features into an impressively portable, user-friendly form factor. Whereas the EOS C70 combines a Super 35mm sensor (similar in size to APS-C) with a DSLR-sized body, the Sony FX3 goes a step further with its full-frame sensor and super-compact body. That said, the EOS C70 claims an added stop of dynamic range (at 16 stops), so it'll be interesting to see how the two compare in the field.  It's not just Sony and Canon slugging it out for the cash of solo or beginner filmmakers either \u2013 we recently also saw the arrival of the much cheaper Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K Pro. That camera combines a Super 35mm sensor with, yes, built-in ND filters for a pretty reasonable $2,495 / \u00a31,879 / AU$3,935 price tag. Naturally, the full-frame Sony FX3, which comes with Sony's class-leading autofocus and other bonuses like twin CFexpress Type A / SD card slots, is a little pricier. It'll be available to buy for $3,899 / \u00a34,200 (around AU$7,460) when it becomes available from mid-March. But when you consider how many of the Sony FX6's features it manages to pack into a 715g body, it could well equal the popularity of the Sony A7S III \u2013\u00a0and possibly even tempt some of the owners of that camera over to the Cinema side.  Prior to the Sony FX3's launch, there was some speculation that the camera has been custom-made for the upcoming Sony Airpeak drone. And Sony has confirmed to us that the two will indeed make a good, if expensive, combo. When we asked if there are any particular aspects of the FX3 that have been designed to help it work with the Sony Airpeak, a Sony spokesperson told us: \"The FX3 is the perfect format to be paired with a drone including the Airpeak drone, but we are not able to comment on specifics\".  This means that we may soon see exactly how the two combine when Sony reveals more about its first drone soon. Sony has previously said that it'll be launching \"a new business targeted for professional photography and video production in the spring of 2021\", which means sometime between March and May. The FX3's suitability for Airpeak isn't a huge surprise, given that the drone's first press shots showed it carrying a Sony A7S III \u2013 a camera that weighs a mere 16g less than the FX3.\u00a0"}, {"source": "techradar.com", "title": "ZipDrive looks to offer cloud storage with some security bonuses", "author": "Anthony Spadafora", "date": "23 February 2021", "fullarticle": "The cloud storage and cloud backup company IDrive has launched a new service called ZipDrive which allows users to create their own personal edge cloud to access, stream, edit and share their local files from anywhere.

Approved by the Superior Court of North Carolina, the lawsuit pressures Epic Games to reimburse players who purchased V-Buck Llamas before the company made the change to the more transparent X-Ray alternatives. If you\u2019re not in the know, a random item loot box is as self-explanatory as it sounds. Usually, players can either pay real money for one or a bundle of loot boxes. The items inside are random until opened, meaning players won\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting until the box has been redeemed. Rarer items are typically much harder to come by, often goading repeat purchases until the desired loot has been acquired. The concept of the random item loot box has been heavily criticized in games like FIFA, Overwatch, Star Wars Battlefront 2 and more. Loot box regulation has been an ongoing debate for years now, and the items themselves have been linked to enabling minors to develop gambling addictions. Laws pertaining to the inclusion of loot boxes in games vary across the globe. They are banned in countries like Belgium and The Netherlands. Lawmakers in the UK have also called for the practice to be heavily regulated."}, {"source": "techradar.com", "title": "Xbox Series X could give Xbox 360 and original Xbox games a renaissance", "author": "Adam Vjestica", "date": "23 February 2021", "fullarticle": "Microsoft\u2019s new FPS Boost feature on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S has the potential to quadruple the framerate of older games without any input from developers \u2013 and it could be used to improve Xbox 360 and original Xbox games.\u00a0 Xbox director of program management Jason Ronald revealed the news during an appearance on the Kinda Funny Podcast (thanks, Pure Xbox), but noted that the team is focusing on Xbox One generation titles first. \u201cRight now, we're focused primarily on Xbox One generation titles because we've seen the best results there. We're still evaluating, can we bring this technology back to Xbox 360 games or original Xbox games?\u201d Ronald said. The majority of Xbox 360 games and original Xbox games in particular ran at 30 frames per second. Using the FPS Boost feature, it\u2019s possible that Microsoft could retroactively double or even quadruple the frame rates of these titles, which would provide a smoother, more responsive gameplay experience. FPS Boost only works with a small selection of titles currently: Watch Dogs 2, Far Cry 4, UFC 4, New Super Lucky\u2019s Tale and Sniper Elite 4. It\u2019s not something that can be easily applied to every backwards compatible game, though, as the technology can create some problems depending on how a game is coded. \u201cThe techniques that we've come up with will not work on every title. We've actually gotten some games working, and honestly, I'm playing the game, it's super awesome, it feels great, it's buttery smooth, but then all of a sudden we realize, \u2018oh, this character over in the corner is animating twice as fast.\u2019\u201d Ronald explained. \u201cOr, maybe three-quarters of the way through the game, all of the sudden we find a physics-breaking bug because the system's running the game so fast that the game doesn't actually know how to handle that.\u201d Despite the challenges that some games may pose, Ronald expects new batches of games that support FPS Boost to be announced every couple of weeks. It means that your existing library of Xbox One games could be dramatically improved, with zero cost to you or input from the original developer."}, {"source": "techradar.com", "title": "Days Gone is coming to PC, and more PlayStation exclusives are on the way", "author": "Hamish Hector", "date": "23 February 2021", "fullarticle": "Even more PlayStation exclusive games are reportedly coming to PC starting with Days Gone sometime in early 2021.\u00a0 PlayStation President and CEO Jim Ryan shared the announcement as part of an interview with GQ, where he also revealed that a new PSVR headset is on the way. Ryan's announcement was also later supported by a tweet from Days Gone developer Bend Studio, who confirmed that its game is coming to PC soon.\u00a0 For now, we don\u2019t know what other games are on the way, but Sony has said more PlayStation exclusives are coming after the port of Horizon Zero Dawn was deemed successful, even if not every fan agreed at launch. PlayStation\u2019s library of exclusive games is exceptionally good, so we\u2019d love to see more of Sony's games launch on PC in the future. Some obvious highlights would be the Last of Us 2, which was dubbed by many as the best game of 2020, and of course God of War, the 2018 soft-reboot of the franchise that took Kratos into the Norse mythos. God of War definitely seems more likely for the near future, with Days Gone and Sony\u2019s other PC port - Horizon Zero Dawn - both being released several years after their console debut. For now, we will have to see what Sony picks next. For years, Sony has lagged behind Microsoft in releasing its games on non-console platforms, so what's different now? Well for one it\u2019s apparently easier to port games to the PC than ever before, particularly as the PS4 and Xbox One were more PC-like in nature. However, at the core of the decision is, of course, money. Jim Ryan highlights that the cost of making games is high, and we only need to look at Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s estimated $330 million budget to see that in action.\u00a0"}, {"source": "techradar.com", "title": "iPhone 12 Pro vs iPhone 12 Pro Max: what's different between Apple\u2019s best phones?", "author": "Jon Mundy", "date": "23 February 2021", "fullarticle": "After several years of incremental updates, the sharp-edged iPhone 12 family has successfully cut through our smartphone apathy with a bold new outlook and a whole new range of upgraded specs such as better internals and 5G connectivity Right at the top of this roster sits the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the iPhone 12 Pro, two lean and speedy apex predators ready to pounce on their rotund rivals. How do these phones differ? You may be surprised to learn it isn't just the size of the handsets. So what is different, and how do they square up to one another? Which is more worthy of the \u2018Pro\u2019 title? And, most importantly, which is the better phone? Here we're going to take a look so you can make the right decision between the iPhone 12 Pro and its even higher spec (and therefore more expensive) Pro Max sibling. The 128GB iPhone 12 Pro hit shops on October 23, 2020, with prices starting from $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699 for the 128GB model. If you want 256GB, you\u2019ll need to stump up $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,899, while a range-topping 512GB model costs $1,299 / \u00a31,299 / AU$2,219. There was a slight delay in the iPhone 12 Pro Max hitting stops, courtesy of the Covid\u201319 outbreak hitting supply chains hard. It finally landed on 13 November, 2020 at a cost of $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,849 for 128GB of storage, rising to $1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,019 for 256GB, and $1,399 / \u00a31,399 / AU$2,369 for 512GB. The above prices are those stated on Apple\u2019s own official store, but you won\u2019t tend to find major savings from third-party retailers. Apple gear holds its value, and we\u2019re still relatively early in the iPhone 12 range\u2019s lifespan. Apple really reset the design clock with the iPhone 12 family. A new angular approach stands in stark contrast to the rounded, softened efforts of the past six years. Both the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro Max are just 7.4mm thick, and sport dead-flat surfaces on all four edges. Only the tightly rounded corners betray any hint of curvature, much as they did with the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 years prior. If you didn\u2019t have anything to provide a sense of scale, you\u2019d find these two young Pros to be identical. Both are available in the same range of four finishes \u2013 Silver, Graphite, Gold, and Pacific Blue \u2013 and each comes with the same shiny fingerprint-attracting stainless steel rim.   Both phones are similarly tough, too, with a front-mounted Ceramic Shield supposedly providing four times the drop-protection of regular display glass. That said, we found quite early in our testing that both phones were still susceptible to picking up small nicks and scratches, just like any other phone. An enhanced IP68 rating, meanwhile, enables both phones to remain immersed in six metres of water for up to 30 minutes. The only significant external difference between these two phones is size. As befits its name, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is much bigger than the iPhone 12 Pro: 14mm taller, 7mm wider, and 39g heavier. Add in a larger camera module (which we\u2019ll talk about later), and the iPhone 12 Pro Max is much less wieldy than the iPhone 12 Pro. You need to really want a large phone before you commit to buying one, since it isn\u2019t the sort of device that will easily slip into a jeans pocket or tiny handbag. One other slight external difference is the relative visual impact of that display notch. The sheer fact that the iPhone 12 Pro Max has a much bigger screen means that Apple\u2019s Face ID-enabling bar feels much less intrusive on the larger phone. The reason the iPhone 12 Pro Max is so big, of course, is that it has a whopping 6.7-inch screen, dwarfing the iPhone 12 Pro\u2019s 6.1-inch alternative. Size aside, though, these displays are remarkably similar. We\u2019re looking at a pair of Super Retina XDR OLEDs, with roughly the same 460ppi(ish) pixel density, the same HDR10 credentials, and the exact same brightness specifications (800 nits typical, 1200 nits peak). They\u2019re stunning screens, capable of outputting bold yet accurate colors and deep blacks. But they also share the same glaring flaw \u2013 the lack of a fast refresh rate. Neither screen can accelerate beyond 60Hz, just like their predecessors. With their Android rivals hitting 90Hz or even 120Hz as a matter of course, this is a bit of an oversight. Especially when Apple set the standard for Pro-themed 120Hz display technology with ProMotion, which made its debut in the 2017 iPad Pro. It should really have made its way into these two Pro phones, too, maybe as a point of difference to the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini. Besides this downer, we found both screens to be among the best out there at rendering images and video. So far so similar, but we\u2019ve now reached one of the key differences between the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the iPhone 12 Pro \u2013 at least on paper. While both phones have a trio of 12-megapixel sensors covering wide, ultrawide, and telephoto angles, and a LiDAR sensor to improve low-light autofocus, there are a couple of key differences. First and foremost among these is a 47% larger image sensor for the main wide camera. This explains the reason the Max\u2019s camera module is noticeably bigger, but it also has the simple benefit of letting in way more light than its little sibling. As a result, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is the low-light king, even in an iPhone 12 range packing a uniformly brilliant Night mode. The larger phone\u2019s telephoto lens also goes to a longer 2.5X, compared to the iPhone 12 Pro\u2019s 2X, although both succeed in getting closer to the wide sensor in tone and quality than before.  These hardware differences aside, we were surprised by the similarities in the quality of most shots between the two. This suggests that much of Apple\u2019s photographic special sauce lies with its computational algorithms and its image processing \u2013 which are, of course, identical on both phones. To that end, both phones have access to advanced Apple features such as Smart HDR 3 and Deep Fusion, which smartly select and combine exposures for more crisp, contrasty shots. Both also get to utilize the new ProRAW standard, which combines the data-packed raw format with the auto-adjusting computational improvements of JPEG. Both phones have the notable ability to shoot Night mode shots across all four cameras \u2013 selfie cam included. That\u2019s pretty darned impressive. And on the video front, both Pros get to shoot Dolby Vision-enhanced video at 4K and 60fps, something their non-Pro brothers can\u2019t quite stretch to. In short, then, the iPhone 12 Pro Max has the better camera of the two, but the difference isn\u2019t as marked as we\u2019d expected. iPhones have become so fast that there\u2019s almost no point to talking about Apple\u2019s year-on-year improvements. Both the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro Max are way faster than their Android rivals, and a healthy 20% faster than last year\u2019s Apple models. When pitched against one another, however, there\u2019s virtually no difference to speak of. Both phones pack Apple\u2019s new A14 Bionic chip and 6GB of RAM, which are nigh-on identical in both benchmarks and our real-world experience There isn\u2019t a 3D game on the App Store that can make either handset break a sweat, with the same true for intensive tasks such as multitasking and photo editing. These phones are as fast as it gets right now, and probably will be until the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max hit the market in late 2021. We\u2019re happy to see that Apple has finally upped its storage game with the two Pro models. Both now feature 128GB as standard, rather than the paltry 64GB of prior Pros. This can be upped to 256GB or 512GB at the checkout \u2013 at a steep price, of course. Apple\u2019s big selling point for the entire iPhone 12 range is 5G. Both the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro Max offer the ability to connect to the next-gen network, where available. And that really isn\u2019t very many places at the time of writing. We\u2019d love to get more excited about 5G, but it\u2019s still something for the future for the majority of people. It\u2019s a good feature to have in the bank for when network operators get into a 5G rollout groove, though.  The iPhone 12 Pro Max\u2019s larger chassis has enabled Apple to include a huge battery \u2013 by Apple standards, at least. At 3,687mAh, the Max cell dwarfs its 2,815mAh brother. It\u2019s a little disappointing to realise that Apple has actually shrunken both batteries compared to their direct predecessors. That\u2019s by more than 200mAh for the 12 Pro, and by almost 300mAh in the case of the Max. When it comes to direct comparisons, though, the iPhone 12 Pro Max battery wins out comfortably, despite having to drive that larger display. It\u2019s the longest-lasting member of the iPhone 12 range, and is the only phone of the four that will last through a full day of intensive use away from a Wi-Fi hotspot. Use of 5G will inevitably see your battery level drop more dramatically, but as we\u2019ve already discussed, this won\u2019t be an issue for most people right now. Apple has put its old MagSafe branding to a new magnetized accessory standard that benefits both phones. You can clip a wireless charger to the back of the phone, which works similarly to a Qi wireless charger, but is more secure. Unfortunately, this MagSafe charger isn\u2019t bundled into either box. Nor is any kind of charging plug, for that matter. All you get with both Pros is a USB-C-to-Lightning cable. If you want to take advantage of Apple\u2019s new 20W fast charging, then you\u2019ll need to spend $19/\u00a319/AU$29 on the appropriate accessory.  The iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro Max are cut from the same cloth. It\u2019s just that the latter uses a larger outline. If you\u2019re a fan of larger phones, the Max is the obvious choice. But if portability and one-handed use are more of a priority, then the Pro is the better pick. That\u2019s the simplified conclusion that can be drawn from our comparison, but there are a couple of added points of nuance that tilt the scales a little. Despite the similarities, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is the better phone overall. It comes with a superior camera that captures brighter, sharper low-light shots, and it also benefits from significantly longer battery life."}, {"source": "techradar.com", "title": "How to watch Mulan: stream the live-action movie online with Disney Plus ", "author": "James Laird", "date": "23 February 2021", "fullarticle": "Mulan is the latest blockbuster movie to be added to the impressive Disney Plus catalogue of exclusives, with the 2020 live-action remake now available on the great value streaming service.

While technically the standard iPhone 12 isn\u2019t the most affordable option in the range (that\u2019s the iPhone 12 mini), it is the clearest iOS alternative to the Galaxy S21. The iPhone 12 and the Samsung Galaxy S21 are similarly priced, have similar screen sizes, and similarly top-end power, among other things, but they also have a whole lot of differences beyond their operating systems. Choosing between them, then, isn\u2019t as simple as choosing iOS or Android. But to make that choice clearer and a little simpler we\u2019ve compared these two flagships across all the most important areas, from design and screen, to camera, battery life, specs, features and price, so you can make an informed decision about which \u2013 if either \u2013 to buy. At first glance the Samsung Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12 look to be similarly priced. After all, the Galaxy S21 starts at $799 / \u00a3769 / AU$1,249, while the iPhone 12 starts at $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,349. However, for that money you\u2019re getting 128GB of storage with the Samsung Galaxy S21 but only 64GB with the iPhone 12. For a 128GB model of the iPhone 12 you\u2019ll have to pay $849 / \u00a3849 / AU$1,429. So the Samsung Galaxy S21 is cheaper, and arguably the better value proposition, especially once you factor in its extra camera lens.\u00a0 As for availability, both phones are now on sale. The Galaxy S21 was revealed in January 2021, whereas the iPhone 12 was revealed in October 2020. The Samsung Galaxy S21 is a premium smartphone but it doesn\u2019t have the most premium of builds. It\u2019s clad in \u2018Glasstic\u2019, which is basically a fancy way of saying plastic that looks like glass. Still, it looks the part, and in our review we found that its matte finish left it feeling fairly premium too - if not quite a match for glass. There\u2019s no real compromise on the front of the device though, where you have an all-screen design with a punch-hole selfie camera. The iPhone 12 meanwhile has a glass back, so it feels as expensive as it looks, but around the front there\u2019s Apple\u2019s typical large notch.  As for the dimensions and weight, the Samsung Galaxy S21 comes in at 151.7 x 71.2 x 7.9mm and 172g, while the iPhone 12 is 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.4mm and 164g. So the two phones are similar in size and weight, but the iPhone 12 is marginally shorter, slimmer, and lighter \u2013 though it\u2019s a touch wider. Color wise, you can get the Samsung Galaxy S21 in Phantom Gray, Phantom White, Phantom Violet, or Phantom Pink, some of which offer contrasting camera colors, while the iPhone 12 comes in black, white, red, green, or blue, and both phones are IP68 certified for water and dust resistance. The Samsung Galaxy S21 has a 6.2-inch 1080 x 2400 Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The iPhone 12 on the other hand has a 6.1-inch 1170 x 2532 Super Retina XDR OLED screen with a 60Hz refresh rate. Looking beyond the marketing terms, these are both OLED screens, and both are very high quality \u2013 in our reviews we were impressed by both. We noted slight disappointment that at Full HD+ the S21's screen is notably a step down from the QHD+ of the Samsung Galaxy S20, but it\u2019s still comparable to the iPhone 12, with that phone offering 460 pixels per inch, while the Samsung Galaxy S21 has 421.  The Samsung Galaxy S21 has a slightly bigger screen than the iPhone 12, but the difference is marginal. The bigger difference is the refresh rate, which is twice as high on Samsung\u2019s new phone, meaning interactions with the screen should feel smoother. Both phones also have a flat screen \u2013 if you\u2019re looking for something curved in the Galaxy S21 range you\u2019ll have to shell out for the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. There\u2019s a triple-lens camera on the back of the Samsung Galaxy S21, with a 12MP f/1.8 main camera, a 64MP f/2.0 telephoto one (with 3x optical zoom), and a 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide. The main and telephoto snappers also have optical image stabilization (OIS). The iPhone 12 meanwhile has a dual-lens camera, with a 12MP f/1.6 main snapper and a 12MP f/2.4 ultra-wide. So it misses out on a telephoto camera, and only the main lens has OIS.  That said, in our review we found that the cameras \u2013 while similar to the iPhone 11\u2019s \u2013 performed well, even handling tricky low light scenes better than many rivals. The Samsung Galaxy S21 has a top camera as well though. This too is similar to its predecessor's, but in our review we were impressed with the zoom potential and the wealth of new modes on offer, such as Director's View, which lets you shoot with front and rear cameras at the same time. Those modes plus the extra lens means Samsung's camera should be a little more versatile. On the front, you get a 10MP f/2.2 camera on Samsung\u2019s phone and a 12MP f/2.2 one on Apple\u2019s. Again, both worked well in our tests. The Samsung Galaxy S21 has a much bigger battery than the iPhone 12, with the former coming in at 4,000mAh, while the latter is just 2,815mAh. You might think that would lead to much longer life from the Galaxy S21 than the iPhone 12, but in our tests we found that while you should generally get a day of life from either, you're unlikely to get much more. The 120Hz refresh rate on the Galaxy S21 has a noticeable detrimental effect on the battery, so that's a big part of why the extra size doesn't mean much extra life. Both phones support fast charging and wireless charging though, with the Samsung Galaxy S21 additionally offering Wireless Power Share, which lets you use the S21 as a wireless charging mat for other devices. It's worth noting though that neither of these phones come with a charger in the box. Both of these phones are packed full of power. In the case of the Samsung Galaxy S21 you get either a Snapdragon 888 chipset (in the US) or an Exynos 2100 (in the UK and most other regions). These are both the top of their respective ranges, and among the very best you\u2019ll find in a phone. The Galaxy S21 also has 8GB of RAM, and a choice of 128GB or 256GB of storage. The iPhone 12 is similarly powerful, with a top-end A14 Bionic chipset, and a choice of 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of storage. It only has 4GB of RAM, but that\u2019s never held Apple\u2019s phones back. In practice we found both phones were as fast as you'd hope, but on the more negative side notably neither of them has a microSD card slot - that's always the case in Apple phones, but Samsung's often do have one. Both phones also support 5G, but they have some different features. The most obvious and arguably biggest difference is the operating system, with the Galaxy S21 running Android 11, while the iPhone 12 runs iOS 14. However, they also have different security options \u2013 with the iPhone 12 the focus is on Face ID, while the Samsung Galaxy S21 has an in-screen fingerprint scanner. These both work well, though Samsung's in-screen solution isn't quite as speedy as a physical fingerprint scanner. The Galaxy S21 also has DeX mode. This is offered by a number of Samsung flagships and allows you to connect the phone up to an external screen and have it display a more desktop-like interface.  The iPhone 12 meanwhile benefits from MagSafe, which allows you to magnetically attach accessories (such as cases, wallets, and wireless chargers) to the back of the phone. Beyond just attaching them though, the phone is also able to tell what you\u2019ve connected to it via MagSafe. At the time of writing the types of available MagSafe accessories are limited, but the selection is likely to improve.  The Samsung Galaxy S21 has more cameras than the iPhone 12, plus more RAM, a bigger battery, a slightly larger screen, a higher refresh rate, and more storage in the entry-level model. The iPhone 12 meanwhile only really has MagSafe and a glass back to help it stand out over the S21 in terms of back-of-the-box bullet points, but both phones are packed full of power, and have all-round impressive specs. Of course, specs don\u2019t always tell the whole story, as evidenced by the fact that the iPhone 12 still has a great camera despite it just being dual-lens, and smooth performance despite just 4GB of RAM."}, {"source": "techradar.com", "title": "Having USB problems with your AMD Ryzen PC?

A number of AMD Ryzen users have been taken to Reddit in recent weeks to vent about intermittent USB connectivity problems on their devices.\u00a0 The ongoing issue has lead to keyboard connection drops, issues with VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, and connection issues with external storage devices and USB-connected coolers, according to the complaints. The USB problems seem to be limited to Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series CPUs in 500-series motherboards, namely the AMD X570 and B550. However, a list of affected systems compiled by Redditors suggests that the issue is mostly occurring in systems with new Nvidia RTX GPUs.\u00a0 While the exact root of the problem remains unclear, AMD has acknowledge the USB connectivity issue in a statement posted to Reddit. \"AMD is aware of reports that a small number of users are experiencing intermittent USB connectivity issues reported on 500 Series chipsets,\" the company said.\u00a0 \u201cWe have been analyzing the root cause and at this time, we would like to request the community\u2019s assistance with a small selection of additional hardware configurations.

Earlier this week, some Fitbit Premium subscribers were alarmed by a user survey that seemed to suggest the company might be planning to increase the price of membership plans. Fitbit was quick to quash any concerns, and explained that it has no plans to change its pricing or privacy policies right now. The company said in a statement that it was continuing to invest in its Premium service \u2013 a claim that appears to be backed up by the set of new wellbeing tools that have begin rolling out in the app today (February 22). The sessions, all of which are less than 20 minutes, were created in collaboration with doctor and meditation advocate Deepak Chopra, and use a combination of audio and video designed to reduce stress and aid sleep.  Although there are many dedicated meditation apps already available (including the likes of Headspace and Calm), it's not surprising that Fitbit has chosen to create its own set of dedicated tools for the purpose. The company has been edging into 'wellness' tech for several years now; guided breathing sessions are available on most of its devices, and last year it launched the stress-detecting Fitbit Sense, which uses your skin's conductivity to determine whether you're feeling tense. The new content can be found in the Discover tab in the Fitbit app, and the sessions can be treated in much the same way as workout routines. This means you can set yourself mindfulness related goals to hit each day or week \u2013 such as starting each day with a meditation, to ending it with guided sleep help. There are 10 audio and video sessions available now, but Fitbit says that dozens more are due to be added over the coming months."}, {"source": "techradar.com", "title": "Galaxy S21 price cut: save $150 on the all-new Samsung Galaxy S21 at Amazon", "author": "Mackenzie Frazier", "date": "23 February 2021", "fullarticle": "If you're looking to score a price cut on the all-new Samsung Galaxy S21, then you're in luck.

We're unlikely to see another new, mainline PlayStation console for a few years yet, but that doesn't mean we can't fantasize about what we would like to see from the next PlayStation - or predict when we're likely to get our hands on it. After all, we know that Sony is already thinking about the future, having trademarked the PS6, PS7, PS8, PS9 and PS10 names. So we've gathered up everything we want to see from the PS6 and when we expect to get our hands on the next PlayStation.  The PS6 is likely to be a long way off. The PS5 only released in November 2020, so it's unlikely Sony will consider releasing a brand new PlayStation for several years. Typically PlayStation consoles launch around six or seven years apart, with the PS4 arriving in 2013 and the PS5 following up in 2020. In an interview with Game Informer, Sony's Executive VP of Hardware Engineering Masayasu Ito confirmed that the PS5 life cycle is expected to last about six or seven years, meaning we won't see the PS6 until at least 2026. \"Indeed, in the past, the cycle for a new platform was seven to 10 years, but in view of the very rapid development and evolution of technology, it's really a six to seven-year platform cycle,\" Masayasu said.\u00a0 \"Then we cannot fully catch up with the rapid development of the technology, therefore our thinking is that as far as a platform is concerned for the PS5, it\u2019s a cycle of maybe six to seven years. But doing that, a platform lifecycle, we should be able to change the hardware itself and try to incorporate advancements in technology.\u00a0 \"That was the thinking behind it, and the test case of that thinking was the PS4 Pro that launched in the midway of the PS4 launch cycle.\" It looks like Sony is following a similar roadmap to the PS4, meaning we're likely to see a PS5 Pro or PS5 Slim release sometime in the middle of this lifecycle: around 2023 or 2024.\u00a0  A smaller console\nThe PS5 is a mammoth console. In fact, it's the biggest console in modern history. But bigger doesn't always mean better, and the PS5's size makes it impractical for those who don't have the shelving unit to house it - and, let's be honest, not many of us do. With the PS6 (and perhaps even with a PS5 Slim Edition), we're hoping that Sony can learn from its mistakes, making the next-gen console smaller and more streamlined, while allowing for adequate airflow. More affordable expandable internal storage\nIt will be possible to expand the PS5's internal storage by popping off the side panel and installing an SSD, once Sony drops a software update to enable it - but it's not that simple. The PS5 only accepts compatible NVMe SSDs, which match or excel past the existing drive specifications, and they don't come cheap. These types of SSDs are typically pretty pricey, meaning that players may opt for external storage instead - but unfortunately, these externals storage options don't harness the raw power of the PS5. With the PS6, we hope that Sony will make expanding internal storage easier - perhaps taking an approach similar to the Xbox Series X's expandable storage card.\u00a0  Built-in Bluetooth Audio Support - so we don't need a dongle for the official headset\nIt is baffling that, in the year 2020, a brand-new games console launched and it requires you to plug-in a USB dongle receiver to use its own-brand wireless headphones. Like, what the actual hell Sony. Talk about an aesthetic assault on our eyes and under-TV storage area. Just build the freaking support into the PS6 will you. Good grief.\u00a0 Wireless charging for controllers/headset - can just be placed on top when off\nSure, the Sony charging dock for the PS5 DualSense controllers works pretty well and the controllers slide nicely against the charging pins - but we don't want yet another piece of hardware by our TV. Sony should take a leaf out of the smartphone industry's book and build in a wireless charging pad to the top of the PS6. That will allow you to place a controller on the top of the console, when you're not gaming, to charge - and you could even expand the wireless charging tech to headphones, a media remote and any other peripherals. Wire-free (and zero-latency) connection to the TV\nThere are far too many wires behind our media stations - and the PlayStation 5 is a guilty party. We've got the power and HDMI, plus a completely separate plug block for the controller charging base. Add in the HD camera, and the additional cable for PSVR 2 when that launches and things are a mess. With the PS6, we want a single power lead and everything else to be wireless - obviously with zero lag and latency."}, {"source": "techradar.com", "title": "Sony WF-1000XM4 wireless earbuds release date, news and leaks", "author": "Olivia Tambini", "date": "23 February 2021", "fullarticle": "The Sony WF-1000XM4 are the rumored follow-up to the best wireless earbuds you can buy right now, the Sony WF-1000XM3 \u2013 and as new leaks emerge, the hype is hotting up around these potentially class-leading in-ear headphones.\u00a0 Still, details of the Sony WF-1000XM4 are thin on the ground. There's been no confirmation from Sony that they even exist, and there's no sign of them at any regulatory bodies like the FCC (Federal Communications Commission).\u00a0 However, images of the Sony WF-1000XM4 have apparently been leaked, after photographs of the packaging was posted to Reddit \u2013 and while they're legitimacy is still in question, we can't help but get excited for Sony's next true wireless earbuds.\u00a0 The images \u2013 if genuine \u2013 have also given us a sneak peek at what looks like a new design and some of the features we can expect from the Sony WF-1000XM4, including active noise cancellation and support for Hi-Res Audio.\u00a0 Of course, we'll need more than unverified images to confirm the existence of the Sony WF-1000XM4, but for now, here's everything we know about the rumored earbuds, as well as all the things we'd like to see.  Right now, there's no firm release date for the Sony WF-1000X4, but we think their launch is fairly imminent, given that it's been one-and-a-half years since the release of their predecessors. The Sony WF-1000XM3 were launched in July 2019, so it's feasible that Sony would release their successors two years later.\u00a0 It also makes sense that Sony would plump for a 2021 release date if the company wants to see off competition from Apple. The tech giant is rumored to be launching the Apple AirPods 3 and the AirPods Pro 2 at some point this year, and the latter in particular could be a rival for the Sony WF-1000XM4 as they'll likely come with active noise cancellation. The fact that images of the Sony WF-1000XM4's packaging have been leaked also suggests that a release date could be coming soon \u2013 though, as we mentioned, these images are yet to be verified as genuine.  Again, there's no word yet on how much the Sony WF-1000XM4 will cost, but we'd be surprised if the company deviated too much from their predecessors' price.\u00a0 When they launched, the Sony WF-1000XM3 cost $230 / \u00a3220 / AU$399, though prices have since dropped significantly as the buds have aged.\u00a0 We expect Sony will target a similar price point for the WF-1000XM4, as it's a pattern we've seen from the brand before with the Sony WH-1000XM3 and the more recent WH-1000XM4 over-ear headphones. Pretty much everything we know about the design of the Sony WF-1000XM4 comes from the packaging photographs posted to Reddit by Key_Attention4766 (via The Walkman Blog). Based on the images, it looks like the Sony WF-1000XM4 will have a sleeker build than their predecessors, with rounder housings and what look like memory foam ear tips.\u00a0 The entirety of the round housings could be touch-sensitive, unlike the Sony WF-1000XM3, which feature a specific touch-sensitive area that allows you to control your music playback, summon your device's voice assistant, accept or reject calls, and enter Quick Attention mode.\u00a0 The gold Sony logo has also changed slightly, now appearing on the side of the earbuds rather than on the top. Meanwhile, a gold accented piece on the outside of the earbuds could be an external noise cancellation microphone, as The Walkman Blog speculates.\u00a0  Again, information on the kind of features we can expect from the Sony WF-1000XM4 is a little thin on the ground, but a few specs have been gleaned from the images of the packaging posted to Reddit.\u00a0 This includes a return of the active noise cancellation technology that made the WF-1000XM3 so popular, and it\u2019s likely that the Ambient Sound and Quick Attention modes will also make an appearance.\u00a0 The packaging also includes a Hi-Res Audio Wireless certification, which means they could come with support for Sony's high resolution LDAC codec, alongside the AAC and SBC codecs already supported by the XM3. There had already been murmurs that the Sony WF-1000XM3 would be getting a Hi-Res Audio upgrade, after the earbuds appeared very briefly on the Qualcomm aptX website, being described as 'aptX HD enabled'. This post was swiftly taken down, but not before it was spotted by The Walkman Blog.\u00a0 As the post appeared in March 2020 and we haven't heard anything since, it's possible that Sony is saving aptX HD support for the WF-1000XM4.\u00a0  While information on the Sony WF-1000XM4 is leaking out in dribs and drabs (indeed, Sony hasn't even confirmed their existence yet), we've had the opportunity to dream up a few things we'd like to see from the fourth-gen true wireless earbuds.\u00a0 Support for 360 Reality Audio We'd love for Sony to furnish the WF-1000XM4 with some of the features seen in the Sony WH-1000XM4, their over-ear siblings (and the best headphones of 2021).\u00a0 One of these features is support for 360 Reality Audio, which is Sony's proprietary immersive sound technology. Designed to put you right in the center of your music, the technology places individual instruments within a virtual sphere, making you feel as though your favorite songs are coming at you from all angles.\u00a0 As well as giving you another way to experience your music, 360 Reality Audio support could make the WF-1000XM3 a real rival for the AirPods Pro, which support Apple's own Spatial Audio tech. DSEE Extreme audio upscaling Another feature that Sony could potentially borrow from the WH-1000XM4 is DSEE Extreme audio upscaling. This AI-driven processing looks to restore detail from lossy compressed formats, and brings clarity to lower quality formats and files, and we were impressed with its capabilities when we tested the WH-1000XM4.\u00a0 Speak-To-Chat and automatic pausing Again, Speak-To-Chat was introduced along with the Sony WH-1000XM4, and we'd love to see it implemented once more with the WF-1000XM4. This feature allows the microphones inside the headphones to recognize when you've started talking, and pause your music while ramping up the ambient noise that\u2019s being funneled into your ears.\u00a0 Speaking of pausing your music, we'd like to see Sony introduce automatic pausing when you remove one earbud. It's something we've seen from lots of wireless earbuds on the market, and it seems like a simple upgrade.\u00a0 Better battery life and wireless charging With every new generation of true wireless earbuds, we like to see an improvement to battery life. The Sony WF-1000XM3 currently offer six hours from the buds themselves, and a further 18 hours from the charging case, and models like the Lypertek PurePlay Z3 have proven that far more is possible these days.\u00a0 Saying that, if the leaked images of the earbuds' packaging are legitimate, it looks like there won't be any change to the battery life at all.\u00a0"}, {"source": "techradar.com", "title": "Here's how NASA Perseverance shot its incredible video of the Mars landing", "author": "Hamish Hector", "date": "23 February 2021", "fullarticle": "The Perseverance rover has put its record-breaking number of cameras to quick use since touching down on Mars, already sending home pictures and video of the red planet, which NASA has released to the public.\u00a0 But how exactly has it managed to shoot such high-quality footage and send it back to earth so quickly? These aren\u2019t the first images we have of Mars, but unlike the ones taken by Curiosity \u2013 Perseverance\u2019s older sibling that landed in 2012 \u2013 these are in full color using 20MP cameras, rather than the measly 1MP black-and-white cameras from before. Along with video of the landing process, NASA also put out an interactive 360-degree panoramic photo of Perseverance\u2019s landing site, using real images taken by the rover on Mars. Perseverance\u2019s mission is all about data collection, searching for absolutely any sign of life it possibly can, so it\u2019s been outfitted with plenty of impressive tools. When it comes to the images we\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re thanks to the rover\u2019s 23 cameras \u2013 seven of which were just to document the entry, descent, and landing of the craft. Using cameras positioned on the rover, its parachute and its sky crane \u2013 a hovering device that lowers the rover more carefully onto Mars \u2013 Perseverance was able to capture the first full video of a rover landing (below), rather than the jerky stop motion Curiosity pulled-off. Landing is one of the most stressful parts of the rover\u2019s mission, with massive heat and a speedy descent through the atmosphere both ready to cause problems and end the mission before it can even begin.\u00a0 This new footage should help NASA scientists understand the process more fully and make improvements to their next Mars landing.\u00a0 The capture of the 360-degree panorama was slightly different, making use of the Navcam on Perseverance's 'head' below.  As Justin Maki, NASA Perseverance's imaging scientist and instrument operations team chief explained in a Tweet on the subject, the panorama was stitched together using several shots and only shows \"approximate color\" of the vista around the rover. NASA says it has thousands of images already and you can download the full-size images from the Mars Perseverance raw images library.\u00a0 \"It's been a firehose of data.\"Justin Maki, @NASAPersevere imaging scientist and instrument operations team chief, reveals a full panorama the rover captured from the surface of Mars: pic.twitter.com/rPExz93glkFebruary 22, 2021 It's one thing taking photos on Mars \u2013 the greater technical challenge is then getting them back to Earth. After all, you can\u2019t just ping them off in an email or upload them to Google Photos as we can here. This is where Nasa\u2019s MAVEN satellite steps in. Not only has it been tasked with monitoring Mars\u2019 atmosphere, but nearly six-and-a-half years after it began orbiting the planet, MAVEN has become an integral part of Perseverance\u2019s mission as a telecommunications relay.  Using its ultra-high frequency (UNF) radio transceiver, MAVEN is able to transmit data at a max rate of about 2048 kbps (kilobits per second) between Earth and the rover. It does this from an adjusted orbit which it took on last year in preparation for Perseverance\u2019s arrival.\u00a0 In the US the average broadband speed is about 120 Mbps (megabits per second), or around 60 times faster, so NASA also used some clever compression to get the image data back quickly.  In a Reddit AMA with scientists and engineers working on Perseverance, Adam Nelessen (EDL Cameras Engineer, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) explained how this was done: \"A key part of the EDL (Entry, Descent and Landing) Cameras instrument is a small computer on the Rover called the Data Storage Unit (DSU). The DSU stored raw images from the 6 EDL Cameras (Rover Uplook, Rover Downlook, Descent Stage Downlook, and Parachute Uplook) and audio captured by the microphone,\" he said. \"We were able to compress the raw images into videos right there on Mars on the DSU, which cuts down dramatically on the data volume needed to send the products back to Earth for all of us to feast our eyes on!\". The good news is that NASA hasn't received all of the images from Mars yet, \"just the videos of the really top priority events\", according to Adam Nelessen. But NASA thinks we'll get full-resolution imagery \"over the coming months\", which is good news for anyone hoping to use it as their new wallpaper.\u00a0 One piece of footage NASA hopes to capture next is a photos and video of Ingenuity in flight on Mars. Ingenuity is a drone-sized helicopter that dropped with Perseverance and is intended to be the first helicopter to fly on another planet.\u00a0 Perseverance will take pictures and recordings of Ingenuity's tests to help NASA confirm if flight is possible on Mars like it is on Earth, when it launches in the next month or two.\u00a0 And according to a Reddit AMA with scientists working on the Perseverance Rover, the \"the Mastcam-Z and navigation cameras will attempt to take images and possibly video of Ingenuity's flight\".  The rover is also fitted with a SkyCam. The purpose is to take science-quality images of the sky above Perseverance to show what the stars look like from another planet. In the same Reddit AMA, scientists and engineers working for NASA told fans to stay tuned for those images to be released at some point soon, too."}, {"source": "techradar.com", "title": "Apple says it has already beaten new M1 Mac malware", "author": "Mayank Sharma", "date": "23 February 2021", "fullarticle": "Apple has moved to squash the threat of another new malware strain threatening its own-brand M1 Mac silicon devices.
